THE CATCHER IN THE RYE by J
D
Salinger      TO   MY   MOTHER     1    If you really want to hear about it the first thing youll probably want to know is where I was born an what my lousy childhood was like and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me and all that David Copperfield kind of crap but I dont feel like going into it if you want to know the truth
In the first place that stuff bores me and in the second place my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them
Theyre quite touchy about anything like that especially my father
Theyre nice and all Im not saying that but theyre also touchy as hell
Besides Im not going to tell you my whole goddam autobiography or anything
Ill just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me around last Christmas just before I got pretty run-down and had to come out here and take it easy
I mean thats all I told DB about and hes my brother and all
Hes in Hollywood
That isnt too far from this crumby place and he comes over and visits me practically every week end
Hes going to drive me home when I go home next month maybe
He just got a Jaguar
One of those little English jobs that can do around two hundred miles an hour
It cost him damn near four thousand bucks
Hes got a lot of dough now
He didnt use to
He used to be just a regular writer when he was home
He wrote this terrific book of short stories The Secret Goldfish in case you never heard of him
The best one in it was The Secret Goldfish
It was about this little kid that wouldnt let anybody look at his goldfish because hed bought it with his own money
It killed me
Now hes out in Hollywood DB being a prostitute
If theres one thing I hate its the movies
Dont even mention them to me
Where I want to start telling is the day I left Pencey Prep
Pencey Prep is this school thats in Agerstown Pennsylvania
You probably heard of it
Youve probably seen the ads anyway
They advertise in about a thousand magazines always showing some hotshot guy on a horse jumping over a fence
Like as if all you ever did at Pencey was play polo all the time
I never even once saw a horse anywhere near the place
And underneath the guy on the horses picture it always says: Since 1888 we have been molding boys into splendid clear-thinking young men
Strictly for the birds
They dont do any damn more molding at Pencey than they do at any other school
And I didnt know anybody there that was splendid and clear-thinking and all
Maybe two guys
If that many
And they probably came to Pencey that way
Anyway it was the Saturday of the football game with Saxon Hall
The game with Saxon Hall was supposed to be a very big deal around Pencey
It was the last game
of the year and you were supposed to commit suicide or something if old Pencey didnt win
I remember around three oclock that afternoon I was standing way the hell up on top of Thomsen Hill right next to this crazy cannon that was in the Revolutionary War and all
You could see the whole field from there and you could see the two teams bashing each other all over the place
You couldnt see the grandstand too hot but you could hear them all yelling deep and terrific on the Pencey side because practically the whole school except me was there and scrawny and faggy on the Saxon Hall side because the visiting team hardly ever brought many people with them
There were never many girls at all at the football games
Only seniors were allowed to bring girls with them
It was a terrible school no matter how you looked at it
I like to be somewhere at least where you can see a few girls around once in a while even if theyre only scratching their arms or blowing their noses or even just giggling or something
Old Selma Thurmer she was the headmasters daughter showed up at the games quite often but she wasnt exactly the type that drove you mad with desire
She was a pretty nice girl though
I sat next to her once in the bus from Agerstown and we sort of struck up a conversation
I liked her
She had a big nose and her nails were all bitten down and bleedy-looking and she had on those damn falsies that point all over the place but you felt sort of sorry for her
What I liked about her she didnt give you a lot of horse manure about what a great guy her father was
She probably knew what a phony slob he was
The reason I was standing way up on Thomsen Hill instead of down at the game was because Id just got back from New York with the fencing team
I was the goddam manager of the fencing team
Very big deal
Wed gone in to New York that morning for this fencing meet with McBurney School
Only we didnt have the meet
I left all the foils and equipment and stuff on the goddam subway
It wasnt all my fault
I had to keep getting up to look at this map so wed know where to get off
So we got back to Pencey around two-thirty instead of around dinnertime
The whole team ostracized me the whole way back on the train
It was pretty funny in a way
The other reason I wasnt down at the game was because I was on my way to say good-by to old Spencer my history teacher
He had the grippe and I figured I probably wouldnt see him again till Christmas vacation started
He wrote me this note saying he wanted to see me before I went home
He knew I wasnt coming back to Pencey
I forgot to tell you about that
They kicked me out
I wasnt supposed to come back after Christmas vacation on account of I was flunking four subjects and not applying myself and all
They gave me frequent warning to start applying myself especially around midterms when my parents came up for a conference with old Thurmer but I didnt do it
So I got the ax
They give guys the ax quite frequently at Pencey
It has a very good academic rating Pencey
It really does
Anyway it was December and all and it was cold as a witchs teat especially on top of that stupid hill
I only had on my reversible and no gloves or anything
The week before that somebodyd stolen my camels-hair coat right out of my room with my fur-lined gloves right in the pocket and all
Pencey was full of crooks
Quite a few guys came from these very wealthy families but it was full of crooks anyway
The more expensive a school is the more crooks it has Im not kidding
Anyway I kept standing next to that crazy cannon looking down at the game and freezing my ass off
Only I wasnt watching the game too much
What I was really hanging around for I was trying to feel some kind
of a good-by
I mean Ive left schools and places I didnt even know I was leaving them
I hate that
I dont care if its a sad good-by or a bad goodby but when I leave a place I like to know Im leaving it
If you dont you feel even worse
I was lucky
All of a sudden I thought of something that helped make me know I was getting the hell out
I suddenly remembered this time in around October that I and Robert Tichener and Paul Campbell were chucking a football around in front of the academic building
They were nice guys especially Tichener
It was just before dinner and it was getting pretty dark out but we kept chucking the ball around anyway
It kept getting darker and darker and we could hardly see the ball any more but we didnt want to stop doing what we were doing
Finally we had to
This teacher that taught biology Mr Zambesi stuck his head out of this window in the academic building and told us to go back to the dorm and get ready for dinner
If I get a chance to remember that kind of stuff I can get a good-by when I need one at least most of the time I can
As soon as I got it I turned around and started running down the other side of the hill toward old Spencers house
He didnt live on the campus
He lived on Anthony Wayne Avenue
I ran all the way to the main gate and then I waited a second till I got my breath
I have no wind if you want to know the truth
Im quite a heavy smoker for one thing that is I used to be
They made me cut it out
Another thing I grew six and a half inches last year
Thats also how I practically got tb and came out here for all these goddam checkups and stuff
Im pretty healthy though
Anyway as soon as I got my breath back I ran across Route 204
It was icy as hell and I damn near fell down
I dont even know what I was running for I guess I just felt like it
After I got across the road I felt like I was sort of disappearing
It was that kind of a crazy afternoon terrifically cold and no sun out or anything and you felt like you were disappearing every time you crossed a road
Boy I rang that doorbell fast when I got to old Spencers house
I was really frozen
My ears were hurting and I could hardly move my fingers at all
Cmon cmon I said right out loud almost somebody open the door
Finally old Mrs Spencer opened
it
They didnt have a maid or anything and they always opened the door themselves
They didnt have too much dough
Holden Mrs Spencer said
How lovely to see you Come in dear Are you frozen to death I think she was glad to see me
She liked me
At least I think she did
Boy did I get in that house fast
How are you Mrs Spencer I said
Hows Mr Spencer   Let me take your coat dear she said
She didnt hear me ask her how Mr Spencer was
She was sort of deaf
She hung up my coat in the hall closet and I sort of brushed my hair back with my hand
I wear a crew cut quite frequently and I never have to comb it much
Howve you been Mrs Spencer I said again only louder so shed hear me
Ive been just fine Holden
She closed the closet door
How have you been The way she asked me I knew right away old Spencerd told her Id been kicked out
Fine I said
Hows Mr Spencer He over his grippe yet   Over it Holden hes behaving like a perfect I dont know what
Hes in his room dear
Go right in
They each had their own room and all
They were both around seventy years old or even more than that
They got a bang out of things though in a haif-assed way of course
I know that sounds mean to say but I dont mean it mean
I just mean that I used to think about old Spencer quite a lot and if you thought about him too much you wondered what the heck he was still living for
I mean he was all stooped over and he had very terrible posture and in class whenever he dropped a piece of chalk at the blackboard some guy in the first row always had to get up and pick it up and hand it to him
Thats awful in my opinion
But if you thought about him just enough and not too much you could figure it out that he wasnt doing too bad for himself
For instance one Sunday when some other guys and I were over there for hot chocolate he showed us this old beat-up Navajo blanket that he and Mrs Spencerd bought off some Indian in Yellowstone Park
You could tell old Spencerd got a big bang out of buying it
Thats what I mean
You take somebody old as hell like old Spencer and they can get a big bang out of buying a blanket
His door was open but I sort of knocked on it anyway just to be polite and all
I could see where he was sitting
He was sitting in a big leather chair all wrapped up in that blanket I just told you about
He looked over at me when I knocked
Whos that he yelled
Caulfield Come in boy
He was always yelling outside class
It got on your nerves sometimes
The minute I went in I was sort of sorry Id come
He was reading the Atlantic Monthly and there were pills and medicine all over the place and everything smelled like Vicks Nose Drops
It was pretty depressing
Im not too crazy about sick people anyway
What made it even more depressing old Spencer had on this very sad ratty old bathrobe that he was probably born in or something
I dont much like to see old guys in their pajamas and bathrobes anyway
Their bumpy old chests are always showing
And their legs
Old guys legs at beaches and places always look so white and unhairy
Hello sir I said
I got your note
Thanks a lot
Hed written me this note asking me to stop by and say good-by before vacation started on account of I wasnt coming back
You didnt have to do all that
Id have come over to say good-by anyway
Have a seat there boy old Spencer said
He meant the bed
I sat down on it
Hows your grippe sir   Mboy if I felt any better Id have to send for the doctor old Spencer said
That knocked him out
He started chuckling like a madman
Then he finally straightened himself out and said Why arent you down at the game I thought this was the day of the big game
It is
I was
Only I just got back from New York with the fencing team I said
Boy his bed was like a rock
He started getting serious as hell
I knew he would
So youre leaving us eh he said
Yes sir
I guess I am
He started going into this nodding routine
You never saw anybody nod as much in your life as old Spencer did
You never knew if he was nodding a lot because he was thinking and all or just because he was a nice old guy that didnt know his ass from his elbow
What did Dr
Thurmer say to you boy I understand you had quite a little chat
Yes we did
We really did
I was in his office for around two hours I guess
Whatd he say to you   Oh
well about Life being a game and all
And how you should play it according to the rules
He was pretty nice about it
I mean he didnt hit the ceiling or anything
He just kept talking about Life being a game and all
You know
Life is a game boy
Life is a game that one plays according to the rules
Yes sir
I know it is
I know it
Game my ass
Some game
If you get on the side where all the hot-shots are then its a game all right Ill admit that
But if you get on the other side where there arent any hot-shots then whats a game about it Nothing
No game
Has Dr
Thurmer written to your parents yet old Spencer asked me
He said he was going to write them Monday
Have you yourself communicated with them   No sir I havent communicated with them because Ill probably see them Wednesday night when I get home
And how do you think theyll take the news   Well
theyll be pretty irritated about it I said
They really will
This is about the fourth school Ive gone to
I shook my head
I shake my head quite a lot
Boy I said
I also say Boy quite a lot
Partly because I have a lousy vocabulary and partly because I act quite young for my age sometimes
I was sixteen then and Im seventeen now and sometimes I act like Im about thirteen
Its really ironical because Im six foot two and a half and I have gray hair
I really do
The one side of my head the right side is full of millions of gray hairs
Ive had them ever since I was a kid
And yet I still act sometimes like I was only about twelve
Everybody says that especially my father
Its partly true too but it isnt all true
People always think somethings all true
I dont give a damn except that I get bored sometimes when people tell me to act my age
Sometimes I act a lot older than I am I really do but people never notice it
People never notice anything
Old Spencer started nodding again
He also started picking his nose
He made out like he was only pinching it but he was really getting the old thumb right in there
I guess he thought it was all right to do because it was only me that was in the room
I didnt care except that its pretty disgusting to watch somebody pick their nose
Then he said I had the privilege of meeting your mother and dad when they had their little chat with Dr
Thurmer some weeks ago
Theyre grand people
Yes they are
Theyre very nice
Grand
Theres a word I really hate
Its a phony
I could puke every time I hear it
Then all of a sudden old Spencer looked like he had something very good something sharp as a tack to say to me
He sat up more in his chair and sort of moved around
It was a false alarm though
All he did was lift the Atlantic Monthly off his lap and try to chuck it on the bed next to me
He missed
It was only about two inches away but he missed anyway
I got up and picked it up and put it down on the bed
All of a sudden then I wanted to get the hell out of the room
I could feel a terrific lecture coming on
I didnt mind the idea so much but I didnt feel like being lectured to and smell Vicks Nose Drops and look at old Spencer in his pajamas and bathrobe all at the same time
I really didnt
It started all right
Whats the matter with you boy old Spencer said
He said it pretty tough too for him
How many subjects did you carry this term  Five sir
Five
And how many are you failing in    Four
I moved my ass a little bit on the bed
It was the hardest bed I ever sat on
I passed English all right I said because I had all that Beowulf and Lord Randal My Son stuff when I was at the Whooton School
I mean I didnt have to do any work in English at all hardly except write compositions once in a while
He wasnt even listening
He hardly ever listened to you when you said something
I flunked you in history because you knew absolutely nothing
I know that sir
Boy I know it
You couldnt help it
Absolutely nothing he said over again
Thats something that drives me crazy
When people say something twice that way after you admit it the first time
Then he said it three times
But absolutely nothing
I doubt very much if you opened your textbook even once the whole term
Did you Tell the truth boy
Well I sort of glanced through it a couple of times I told him
I didnt want to hurt his feelings
He was mad about history
You glanced through it eh he said very sarcastic
Your ah exam paper is over there on top of my chiffonier
On top of the pile
Bring it here please
It was a very dirty trick but I went over and brought it over to him I didnt have any alternative or anything
Then I sat down on his cement bed again
Boy you cant imagine how sorry I was getting that Id stopped by to say good-by to him
He started handling my exam paper like it was a turd or something
We studied the Egyptians from November 4th to December 2nd he said
You chose to write about them for the optional essay question
Would you care to hear what you had to say   No sir not very much I said
He read it anyway though
You cant stop a teacher when they want to do something
They just do it
The Egyptians were an ancient race of Caucasians residing in       one of the northern sections of Africa
The latter as we all       know is the largest continent in the Eastern Hemisphere
I had to sit there and listen to that crap
It certainly was a dirty trick
The Egyptians are extremely interesting to us today for        various reasons
Modern science would still like to know what        the secret ingredients were that the Egyptians used when they       wrapped up dead people so that their faces would not rot for       innumerable centuries
This interesting riddle is still quite       a challenge to modern science in the twentieth century
He stopped reading and put my paper down
I was beginning to sort of hate him
Your essay shall we say ends there he said in this very sarcastic voice
You wouldnt
think such an old guy would be so sarcastic and all
However you dropped me a little note at the bottom of the page he said
I know I did I said
I said it very fast because I wanted to stop him before he started reading that out loud
But you couldnt stop him
He was hot as a firecracker
DEAR MR
SPENCER [he read out loud]
That is all I know about       the Egyptians
I cant seem to get very interested in them       although your lectures are very interesting
It is all right       with me if you flunk me though as I am flunking everything       else except English anyway
Respectfully yours HOLDEN CAULFIELD
He put my goddam paper down then and looked at me like hed just beaten hell out of me in ping-pong or  something
I dont think Ill ever forgive him for reading me that crap out loud
I wouldntve read it out loud to him if hed written it I really wouldnt
In the first place Id only written that damn note so that he wouldnt feel too bad about flunking me
Do you blame me for flunking you boy he said
No sir I certainly dont I said
I wished to hell hed stop calling me boy all the time
He tried chucking my exam paper on the bed when he was through with it
Only he missed again naturally
I had to get up again and pick it up and put it on top of the Atlantic Monthly
Its boring to do that every two minutes
What would you have done in my place he said
Tell the truth boy
Well you could see he really felt pretty lousy about flunking me
So I shot the bull for a while
I told him I was a real moron and all that stuff
I told him how I wouldve done exactly the same thing if Id been in his place and how most people didnt appreciate how tough it is being a teacher
That kind of stuff
The old bull
The funny thing is though I was sort of thinking of something else while I shot the bull
I live in New York and I was thinking about the lagoon in Central Park down near Central Park South
I was wondering if it would be frozen over when I got home and if it was where did the ducks go
I was wondering where the ducks went when the lagoon got all icy and frozen over
I wondered if some guy came in a truck and took them away to a zoo or something
Or if they just flew away
Im lucky though
I mean I could shoot the old bull to old Spencer and think about those ducks at the same time
Its funny
You dont have to think too hard when you talk to a teacher
All of a sudden though he interrupted me while I was shooting the bull
He was always interrupting you
How do you feel about all this boy Id be very interested to know
Very interested
You mean about my flunking out of Pencey and all I said
I sort of wished hed cover up his bumpy chest
It wasnt such a beautiful view
If Im not mistaken I believe you also had some difficulty at the Whooton School and at Elkton Hills
He didnt say it just sarcastic but sort of nasty too
I didnt have too much difficulty at Elkton Hills I told him
I didnt exactly flunk out or anything
I just quit sort of
Why may I ask   Why Oh well its a long story sir
I mean its pretty complicated
I didnt feel like going into the whole thing with him
He wouldnt have understood it anyway
It wasnt up his alley at all
One of the biggest reasons I left Elkton Hills was because I was surrounded by phonies
Thats all
They were coming in the goddam window
For instance they had this headmaster Mr Haas that was the phoniest bastard I ever met in my life
Ten times worse than old Thurmer
On Sundays for instance old Haas went around shaking hands with everybodys parents when they drove up to school
Hed be charming as hell and all
Except if some boy had little old funny-looking parents
You shouldve seen the way he did with my roommates parents
I mean if a boys mother was sort of fat or corny-looking or something and if somebodys father was one of those guys that wear those suits with very big shoulders and corny black-and-white shoes then old Hans would just shake hands with them and give them a phony smile and then hed go talk for maybe a half an hour with somebody elses parents
I cant stand that stuff
It drives me crazy
It makes me so depressed I go crazy
I hated that goddam Elkton Hills
Old Spencer asked me something then but I didnt hear him
I was thinking about old Haas
What sir I said
Do you have any particular qualms about leaving Pencey   Oh I have a few qualms all right
Sure
but not too many
Not yet anyway
I guess it hasnt really hit me yet
It takes things a while to hit me
All Im doing right now is thinking about going home Wednesday
Im a moron
Do you feel absolutely no concern for your future boy   Oh I feel some concern for my future all right
Sure
Sure I do
I thought about it for a minute
But not too much I guess
Not too much I guess
You will old Spencer said
You will boy
You will when its too late
I didnt like hearing him say that
It made me sound dead or something
It was very depressing
I guess I will I said
Id like to put some sense in that head of yours boy
Im trying to help you
Im trying to help you if I can
He really was too
You could see that
But it was just that we were too much on opposite sides ot the pole thats all
I know you are sir I said
Thanks a lot
No kidding
I appreciate it
I really do
I got up from the bed then
Boy I couldntve sat there another ten minutes to save my life
The thing is though I have to get going now
I have quite a bit of equipment at the gym I have to get to take home with me
I really do
He looked up at me and started nodding again with this very serious look on his face
I felt sorry as hell for him all of a sudden
But I just couldnt hang around there any longer the way we were on opposite sides of the pole and the way he kept missing the bed whenever he chucked something at it and his sad old bathrobe with his chest showing and that grippy smell of Vicks Nose Drops all over the place
Look sir
Dont worry about me I said
I mean it
Ill be all right
Im just going through a phase right now
Everybody goes through phases and all dont they   I dont know boy
I dont know
I hate it when somebody answers that way
Sure
Sure they do I said
I mean it sir
Please dont worry about me
I sort of put my hand on his shoulder
Okay I said
Wouldnt you like a cup of hot chocolate before you go Mrs Spencer would be    I would I really would but the thing is I have to get going
I have to go right to the gym
Thanks though
Thanks a lot sir
Then we shook hands
And all that crap
It made me feel sad as hell though
Ill drop you a line sir
Take care of your grippe now
Good-by boy
After I shut the door and started back to the living room he yelled something at me but I couldnt exactly hear him
Im pretty sure he yelled Good luck at me   I hope to hell not
Id never yell Good luck at anybody
It sounds terrible when you think about it
Im the most terrific liar you ever saw in your life
Its awful
If Im on my way to the store to buy a magazine even and somebody asks me where Im going Im liable to say Im going to the opera
Its terrible
So when I told old Spencer I had to go to the gym and get my equipment and stuff that was a sheer lie
I dont even keep my goddam equipment in the gym
Where I lived at Pencey I lived in the Ossenburger Memorial Wing of the new dorms
It was only for juniors and seniors
I was a junior
My roommate was a senior
It was named after this guy Ossenburger that went to Pencey
He made a pot of dough in the undertaking business after he got out of Pencey
What he did he started these undertaking parlors all over the country that you could get members of your family buried for about five bucks apiece
You should see old Ossenburger
He probably just shoves them in a sack and dumps them in the river
Anyway he gave Pencey a pile of dough and they named our wing alter him
The first football game of the year he came up to school in this big goddam Cadillac and we all had to stand up in the grandstand and give him a locomotive thats a cheer
Then the next morning in chapel be made a speech that lasted about ten hours
He started off with about fifty corny jokes just to show us what a regular guy he was
Very big deal
Then he started telling us how he was never ashamed when he was in some kind of trouble or something to get right down his knees and pray to God
He told us we should always pray to God talk to Him and all wherever we were
He told us we ought to think of Jesus as our buddy and all
He said he talked to Jesus all the time
Even when he was driving his car
That killed me
I just see the big phony bastard shifting into first gear and asking Jesus to send him a few more stiffs
The only good part of his speech was right in the middle of it
He was telling us all about what a swell guy he was what a hot-shot and all then all of a sudden this guy sitting in the row in front of me Edgar Marsalla laid this terrific fart
It was a very crude thing to do in chapel and all but it was also quite amusing
Old Marsalla
He damn near blew the roof off
Hardly anybody laughed out loud and old Ossenburger made out like he didnt even hear it but old Thurmer the headmaster was sitting right next to him on the rostrum and all and you could tell he heard it
Boy was he sore
He didnt say anything then but the next night he made us have compulsory study hall in the academic building and he came up and made a speech
He said that the boy that had created the
disturbance in chapel wasnt fit to go to Pencey
We tried to get old Marsalla to rip off another one right while old Thurmer was making his speech but be wasnt in the right mood
Anyway thats where I lived at Pencey
Old Ossenburger Memorial Wing in the new dorms
It was pretty nice to get back to my room after I left old Spencer because everybody was down at the game and the heat was on in our room for a change
It felt sort of cosy
I took off my coat and my tie and unbuttoned my shirt collar; and then I put on this hat that Id bought in New York that morning
It was this red hunting hat with one of those very very long peaks
I saw it in the window of this sports store when we got out of the subway just after I noticed Id lost all the goddam foils
It only cost me a buck
The way I wore it I swung the old peak way around to the back very corny Ill admit but I liked it that way
I looked good in it that way
Then I got this book I was reading and sat down in my chair
There were two chairs in every room
I had one and my roommate Ward Stradlater had one
The arms were in sad shape because everybody was always sitting on them but they were pretty comfortable chairs
The book I was reading was this book I took out of the library by mistake
They gave me the wrong book and I didnt notice it till I got back to my room
They gave me Out of Africa by Isak Dinesen
I thought it was going to stink but it didnt
It was a very good book
Im quite illiterate but I read a lot
My favorite author is my brother DB and my next favorite is Ring Lardner
My brother gave me a book by Ring Lardner for my birthday just before I went to Pencey
It had these very funny crazy plays in it and then it had this one story about a traffic cop that falls in love with this very cute girl thats always speeding
Only hes married the cop so be cant marry her or anything
Then this girl gets killed because shes always speeding
That story just about killed me
What I like best is a book thats at least funny once in a while
I read a lot of classical books like The Return of the Native and all and I like them and I read a lot of war books and mysteries and all but they dont knock me out too much
What really knocks me out is a book that when youre all done reading it you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it
That doesnt happen much though
I wouldnt mind calling this Isak Dinesen up
And Ring Lardner except that DB told me hes dead
You take that book Of Human Bondage by Somerset Maugham though
I read it last summer
Its a pretty good book and all but I wouldnt want to call Somerset Maugham up
I dont know He just isnt the kind of guy Id want to call up thats all
Id rather call old Thomas Hardy up
I like that Eustacia Vye
Anyway I put on my new hat and sat down and started reading that book Out of Africa
Id read it already but I wanted to read certain parts over again
Id only read about three pages though when I heard somebody coming through the shower curtains
Even without looking up I knew right away who it was
It was Robert Ackley this guy that roomed right next to me
There was a shower right between every two rooms in our wing and about eighty-five times a day old Ackley barged in on me
He was probably the only guy in the whole dorm besides me that wasnt down at the game
He hardly ever went anywhere
He was a very peculiar guy
He was a senior and hed been at Pencey the whole four years and all but nobody ever called him anything except Ackley
Not even Herb Gale his own roommate ever called him Bob or even Ack
If he ever gets married his own wifell probably call him Ackley
He was one of these very very tall round-shouldered guys he was about six four with lousy teeth
The whole time he
roomed next to me I never even once saw him brush his teeth
They always looked mossy and awful and he damn near made you sick if you saw him in the dining room with his mouth full of mashed potatoes and peas or something
Besides that he had a lot of pimples
Not just on his forehead or his chin like most guys but all over his whole face
And not only that he had a terrible personality
He was also sort of a nasty guy
I wasnt too crazy about him to tell you the truth
I could feel him standing on the shower ledge right behind my chair taking a look to see if Stradlater was around
He hated Stradlaters guts and he never came in the room if Stradlater was around
He hated everybodys guts damn near
He came down off the shower ledge and came in the room
Hi he said
He always said it like he was terrifically bored or terrifically tired
He didnt want you to think he was visiting you or anything
He wanted you to think hed come in by mistake for Gods sake
Hi I said but I didnt look up from my book
With a guy like Ackley if you looked up from your book you were a goner
You were a goner anyway but not as quick if you didnt look up right away
He started walking around the room very slow and all the way he always did picking up your personal stuff off your desk and chiffonier
He always picked up your personal stuff and looked at it
Boy could he get on your nerves sometimes
How was the fencing he said
He just wanted me to quit reading and enjoying myself
He didnt give a damn about the fencing
We win or what he said
Nobody won I said
Without looking up though
What he said
He always made you say everything twice
Nobody won I said
I sneaked a look to see what he was fiddling around with on my chiffonier
He was looking at this picture of this girl I used to go around with in New York Sally Hayes
He mustve picked up that goddam picture and looked at it at least five thousand times since I got it
He always put it back in the wrong place too when he was finished
He did it on purpose
You could tell
Nobody won he said
How come   I left the goddam foils and stuff on the subway
I still didnt look up at him
On the subway for Chrissake Ya lost them ya mean   We got on the wrong subway
I had to keep getting up to look at a goddam map on the wall
He came over and stood right in my light
Hey I said
Ive read this same sentence about twenty times since you came in
Anybody else except Ackley wouldve taken the goddam hint
Not him though
Think theyll make ya pay for em he said
I dont know and I dont give a damn
How bout sitting down or something Ackley kid Youre right in my goddam light
He didnt like it when you called him Ackley kid
He was always telling me I was a goddam kid because I was sixteen and he was eighteen
It drove him mad when I called him Ackley kid
He kept standing there
He was exactly the kind of a guy that wouldnt get out of your light when you asked him to
Hed do it finally but it took him a lot longer if you asked him to
What the hellya reading he said
Goddam book
He shoved my book back with his hand so that he could see the name of it
Any good he said
This sentence Im reading is terrific
I can be quite sarcastic when Im in the mood
He didnt get It though
He started walking around the room again picking up all my personal stuff and Stradlaters
Finally I put my book down on the floor
You couldnt read anything with a guy like Ackley around
It was impossible
I slid way the hell down in my chair and watched old Ackley making himself at home
I was feeling sort of tired from the trip to New York and all and I started yawning
Then I started horsing around a little bit
Sometimes I horse around quite a lot just to keep from getting bored
What I did was I pulled the old peak of my hunting hat around to the front then pulled it way down over my eyes
That way I couldnt see a goddam thing
I think Im going blind I said in this very hoarse voice
Mother darling everythings getting so dark in here
Youre nuts
I swear to God Ackley said
Mother darling give me your hand Why wont you give me your hand   For Chrissake grow up
I started groping around in front of me like a blind guy but without getting up or anything
I kept saying Mother darling why wont you give me your hand I was only horsing around naturally
That stuff gives me a bang sometimes
Besides I know it annoyed hell out of old Ackley
He always brought out the old sadist in me
I was pretty sadistic with him quite often
Finally I quit though
I pulled the peak around to the back again and relaxed
Who belongsa this Ackley said
He was holding my roommates knee supporter up to show me
That guy Ackleyd pick up anything
Hed even pick up your jock strap or something
I told him it was Stradlaters
So he chucked it on Stradlaters bed
He got it off Stradlaters chiffonier so he chucked it on the bed
He came over and sat down on the arm of Stradlaters chair
He never sat down in a chair
Just always on the arm
Where the hellja get that hat he said
New York
How much  A buck
You got robbed
He started cleaning his goddam fingernails with the end of a match
He was always cleaning his fingernails
It was funny in a way
His teeth were always mossy-looking and his ears were always dirty as hell but he was always cleaning his fingernails
I guess he thought that made him a very neat guy
He took another look at my hat while he was cleaning them
Up home we wear a hat like that to shoot deer in for Chrissake he said
Thats a deer shooting hat
Like hell it is
I took it off and looked at it
I sort of closed one eye like I was taking aim at it
This is a people shooting hat I said
I shoot people in this hat
Your folks know you got kicked out yet  Nope
Where the hells Stradlater at anyway   Down at the game
Hes got a date
I yawned
I was yawning all over the place
For one thing the room was too damn hot
It made you sleepy
At Pencey you either froze to death or died of the heat
The great Stradlater Ackley said
Hey
Lend me your scissors a second willya Ya got em handy   No
I packed them already
Theyre way in the top of the closet
Get em a second willya Ackley said I got this hangnail I want to cut off
He didnt care if youd packed something or not and had it way in the top of the closet
I got them for him though
I nearly got killed doing it too
The second I opened the closet door Stradlaters tennis racket in its wooden press and all fell right on my head
It made a big clunk and it hurt like hell
It damn near killed old Ackley though
He started laughing in this very high falsetto voice
He kept laughing the whole time I was taking down my suitcase and getting the scissors out for him
Something like that a guy getting hit on the head with a rock or something tickled the pants off Ackley
You have a damn good sense of humor Ackley kid I told him
You know that I handed him the scissors
Lemme be your manager
Ill get you on the goddam radio
I sat down in my chair again and he started cutting his big horny-looking nails
How bout using the table or something I said
Cut em over the table willya I dont feel like walking on your crumby nails in my bare feet tonight
He kept right on cutting them over the floor though
What lousy manners
I mean it
Whos Stradlaters date he said
He was always keeping tabs on who Stradlater was dating even though he hated Stradlaters guts
I dont know
Why   No reason
Boy I cant stand that sonuvabitch
Hes one sonuvabitch I really cant stand
Hes crazy about you
He told me he thinks youre a goddam prince I said
I call people a prince quite often when Im horsing around
It keeps me from getting bored or something
Hes got this superior attitude all the time Ackley said
I just cant stand the sonuvabitch
Youd think he    Do you mind cutting your nails over the table hey I said
Ive asked you about fifty    Hes got this goddam superior attitude all the time Ackley said
I dont even think the sonuvabitch is intelligent
He thinks he is
He thinks hes about the most    Ackley For Chrissake
Willya please cut your crumby nails over the table Ive asked you fifty times
He started cutting his nails over the table for a change
The only way he ever did anything was if you yelled at him
I watched him for a while
Then I said The reason youre sore at Stradlater is because he said that stuff about brushing your teeth once in a while
He didnt mean to insult you for cryin out loud
He didnt say it right or anything but he didnt mean anything insulting
All he meant was youd look better and feel better if you sort of brushed your teeth once in a while
I brush my teeth
Dont gimme that
No you dont
Ive seen you and you dont I said
I didnt say it nasty though
I felt sort of sorry for him in a way
I mean it isnt too nice naturally if somebody tells you you dont brush your teeth
Stradlaters all right Hes not too bad I said
You dont know him thats the trouble
I still say hes a sonuvabitch
Hes a conceited sonuvabitch
Hes conceited but hes very generous in some things
He really is I said
Look
Suppose for instance Stradlater was wearing a tie or something that you liked
Say he had a tie on that you liked a helluva lot Im just giving you an example now
You know what hed do Hed probably take it off and give it ta you
He really would
Or you know what hed do Hed leave it on your bed or something
But hed give you the goddam tie
Most guys would probably just    Hell Ackley said
If I had his dough I would too
No you wouldnt
I shook my head
No you wouldnt Ackley kid
If you had his dough youd be one of the biggest    Stop calling me Ackley kid God damn it
Im old enough to be your lousy father
No youre not
Boy he could really be aggravating sometimes
He never missed a chance to let you know you were sixteen and he was eighteen
In the first place I wouldnt let you in my goddam family I said
Well just cut out calling me    All of a sudden the door opened and old Stradlater barged in in a big hurry
He was always in a big hurry
Everything was a very big deal
He came over to me and gave me these two playful as hell slaps on both cheeks which is something that can be very annoying
Listen he said
You going out anywheres special tonight   I dont know
I might
What the hells it doing out snowing He had snow all over his coat
Yeah
Listen
If youre not going out anyplace special how bout lending me your hounds-tooth jacket   Who won the game I said
Its only the half
Were leaving Stradlater said
No kidding you gonna use your hounds-tooth tonight or not I spilled some crap all over my gray flannel
No but I dont want you stretching it with your goddam shoulders and all I said
We were practically the same heighth but he weighed about twice as much as I did
He had these very broad shoulders
I wont stretch it
He went over to the closet in a big hurry
Howsa boy Ackley he said to Ackley
He was at least a pretty friendly guy Stradlater
It was partly a phony kind of friendly but at least he always said hello to Ackley and all
Ackley just sort of grunted when he said Howsa boy He wouldnt answer him but he didnt have guts enough not to at least grunt
Then he said to me I think Ill get going
See ya later
Okay I said
He never exactly broke your heart when he went back to his own room
Old Stradlater started taking off his coat and tie and all
I think maybe Ill take a fast shave he said
He had a pretty heavy beard
He really did
Wheres your date I asked him
Shes waiting in the Annex
He went out of the room with his toilet kit and towel under his arm
No shirt on or anything
He always walked around in his bare torso because he thought he had a damn good build
He did too
I have to admit it
I didnt have anything special to do so I went down to the can and chewed the rag with him while he was shaving
We were the only ones in the can because everybody was still down at the game
It was hot as hell and the windows were all steamy
There were about ten washbowls all right against the wall
Stradlater had the middle one
I sat down on the one right next to him and started turning the cold water on and off this nervous habit I have
Stradlater kept whistling Song of India while he shaved
He had one of those very piercing whistles that are practically never in tune and he always picked out some song thats hard to whistle even if youre a good whistler like Song of India or Slaughter on Tenth Avenue
He could really mess a song up
You remember I said before that Ackley was a slob in his personal habits Well so was Stradlater but in a different way
Stradlater was more of a secret slob
He always looked all right Stradlater but for instance you shouldve seen the razor he shaved himself with
It was always rusty as hell and full of lather and hairs and crap
He never cleaned it or anything
He always looked good when he was finished fixing himself up but he was a secret slob anyway if you knew him the way I did
The reason he fixed himself up to look good was because he was madly in love with himself
He thought he was the handsomest guy in the Western Hemisphere
He was pretty handsome too Ill admit it
But he was mostly the kind of a handsome guy that if your parents saw his picture in your Year Book theyd right away say Whos this boy I mean he was mostly a Year Book kind of handsome guy
I knew a lot of guys at Pencey I thought were a lot handsomer than Stradlater but they wouldnt look handsome if you saw their pictures in the Year Book
Theyd look like they had big noses or their ears stuck out
Ive had that experience frequently
Anyway I was sitting on the washbowl next to where Stradlater was shaving sort of turning the water on and off
I still had my red hunting hat on with the peak around to the back and all
I really got a bang out of that hat
Hey Stradlater said
Wanna do me a big favor   What I said
Not too enthusiastic
He was always asking you to do him a big favor
You take a very handsome guy or a guy that thinks hes a real hot-shot and theyre always asking you to do them a big favor
Just because theyre crazy about themseif they think youre crazy about them too and that youre just dying to do them a favor
Its sort of funny in a way
You goin out tonight he said
I might
I might not
I dont know
Why   I got about a hundred pages to read for history for Monday he said
How bout writing a composition for me for English Ill be up the creek if I dont get the goddam thing in by Monday the reason I ask
How bout it    It was very ironical
It really was
Im the one thats flunking out of the goddam place and youre asking me to write you a goddam composition I said
Yeah I know
The thing is though Ill be up the creek if I dont get it in
Be a buddy
Be a buddyroo
Okay   I didnt answer him right away
Suspense is good for some bastards like Stradlater
What on I said
Anything
Anything descriptive
A room
Or a house
Or something you once lived in or something  you know
Just as long as its descriptive as hell
He gave out a big yawn while he said that
Which is something that gives me a royal pain in the ass
I mean if somebody yawns right while theyre asking you to do them a goddam favor
Just dont do it too good is all he said
That sonuvabitch Hartzell thinks youre a hot-shot in English and he knows youre my roommate
So I mean dont stick all the commas and stuff in the right place
Thats something else that gives me a royal pain
I mean if youre good at writing compositions and somebody starts talking about commas
Stradlater was always doing that
He wanted you to think that the only reason he was lousy at writing compositions was because he stuck all the commas in the wrong place
He was a little bit like Ackley that way
I once sat next to Ackley at this basketball game
We had a terrific guy on the team Howie Coyle that could sink them from the middle of the floor without even touching the backboard or anything
Ackley kept saying the whole goddam game that Coyle had a perfect build for basketball
God how I hate that stuff
I got bored sitting on that washbowl after a while so I backed up a few feet and started doing this tap dance just for the hell of it
I was just amusing myself
I cant really tap-dance or anything but it was a stone floor in the can and it was good for tap-dancing
I started imitating one of those guys in the movies
In one of those musicals
I hate the movies like poison but I get a bang imitating them
Old Stradlater watched me in the mirror while he was shaving
All I needs an audience
Im an exhibitionist
Im the goddarn Governors son I said
I was knocking myself out
Tap-dancing all over the place
He doesnt want me to be a tap dancer
He wants me to go to Oxford
But its in my goddam blood tap-dancing
Old Stradlater laughed
He didnt have too bad a sense of humor
Its the opening night of the Ziegfeld Follies
I was getting out of breath
I have hardly any wind at all
The leading man cant go on
Hes drunk as a bastard
So who do they get to take his place Me thats who
The little ole goddam Governors son
Wheredja get that hat Stradlater said
He meant my hunting hat
Hed never seen it before
I was out of breath anyway so I quit horsing around
I took off my hat and looked at it for about the ninetieth time
I got it in New York this morning
For a buck
Ya like it   Stradlater nodded
Sharp he said
He was only flattering me though because right away he said Listen
Are ya gonna write that composition for me I have to know
If I get the time I will
If I dont I wont I said
I went over and sat down at the washbowl next to him again
Whos your date I asked him
Fitzgerald   Hell no I told ya
Im through with that pig
Yeah Give her to me boy
No kidding
Shes my type
Take her 
Shes too old for you
All of a sudden for no good reason really except that I was sort of in the mood for horsing around I felt like jumping off the washbowl and getting old Stradlater in a half nelson
Thats a wrestling hold in case you dont know where you get the other guy around the neck and choke him to death if you feel like it
So I did it
I landed on him like a goddam panther
Cut it out Holden for Chrissake Stradlater said
He didnt feel like horsing around
He was shaving and all
Wuddaya wanna make me do cut my goddam head off   I didnt let go though
I had a pretty good half nelson on him
Liberate yourself from my viselike grip
I said
Je-sus Christ
He put down his razor and all of a sudden jerked his arms up and sort of broke my hold on him
He was a very strong guy
Im a very weak guy
Now cut out the crap he said
He started shaving himself all over again
He always shaved himself twice to look gorgeous
With his crumby old razor
Who is your date if it isnt Fitzgerald I asked him
I sat down on the washbowl next to him again
That Phyllis Smith babe   No
It was supposed to he but the arrangements got all screwed up
I got Bud Thaws girls roommate now 
Hey
I almost forgot
She knows you
Who does I said
My date
Yeah I said
Whats her name I was pretty interested
Im thinking 
Uh
Jean Gallagher
Boy I nearly dropped dead when he said that
Jane Gallagher I said
I even got up from the washbowl when he said that
I damn near dropped dead
Youre damn right I know her
She practically lived right next door to me the summer before last
She had this big damn Doberman pinscher
Thats how I met her
Her dog used to keep coming over in our    Youre right in my light Holden for Chrissake Stradlater said
Ya have to stand right there   Boy was I excited though
I really was
Where is she I asked him
I oughta go down and say hello to her or something
Where is she In the Annex  Yeah
Howd she happen to mention me Does she go to B
M
now She said she might go there
She said she might go to Shipley too
I thought she went to Shipley
Howd she happen to mention me I was pretty excited
I really was
I dont know for Chrissake
Lift up willya Youre on my towel Stradlater said
I was sitting on his stupid towel
Jane Gallagher I said
I couldnt get over it
Jesus H
Christ
Old Stradlater was putting Vitalis on his hair
My Vitalis
Shes a dancer I said
Ballet and all
She used to practice about two hours every day right in the middle of the hottest weather and all
She was worried that it might make her legs lousy all thick and all
I used to play checkers with her all the time
You used to play what with her all the time  Checkers
Checkers for Chrissake   Yeah
She wouldnt move any of her kings
What shed do when shed get a king she wouldnt move it
Shed just leave it in the back row
Shed get them all lined up in the back row
Then shed never use them
She just liked the way they looked when they were all in the back row
Stradlater didnt say anything
That kind of stuff doesnt interest most people
Her mother belonged to the same club we did I said
I used to caddy once in a while just to make some dough
I caddyd for her mother a couple of times
She went around in about a hundred and seventy for nine holes
Stradlater wasnt hardly listening
He was combing his gorgeous locks
I oughta go down and at least say hello to her I said
Why dontcha   I will in a minute
He started parting his hair all over again
It took him about an hour to comb his hair
Her mother and father were divorced
Her mother was married again to some booze hound I said
Skinny guy with hairy legs
I remember him
He wore shorts all the time
Jane said he was supposed to be a playwright or some goddam thing but all I ever saw him do was booze all the time and listen to every single goddam mystery program on the radio
And run around the goddam house naked
With Jane around and all
Yeah Stradlater said
That really interested him
About the booze hound running around the house naked with Jane around
Stradlater was a very sexy bastard
She had a lousy childhood
Im not kidding
That didnt interest Stradlater though
Only very sexy stuff interested him
Jane Gallagher
Jesus 
I couldnt get her off my mind
I really couldnt
I oughta go down and say hello to her at least
Why the hell dontcha instead of keep saying it Stradlater said
I walked over to the window but you couldnt see out of it it was so steamy from all the heat in the can
Im not in the mood right now I said
I wasnt either
You have to be in the mood for those things
I thought she went to Shipley
I couldve sworn she went to Shipley
I walked around the can for a little while
I didnt have anything else to do
Did she enjoy the game I said
Yeah I guess so
I dont know
Did she tell you we used to play checkers all the time or anything   I dont know
For Chrissake I only just met her Stradlater said
He was finished combing his goddam gorgeous hair
He was putting away all his crumby toilet articles
Listen
Give her my regards willya   Okay Stradlater said but I knew he probably wouldnt
You take a guy like Stradlater they never  give your regards to people
He went back to the room but I stuck around in the can for a while thinking about old Jane
Then I went back to the room too
Stradlater was putting on his tie in front of the mirror when I got there
He spent around half his goddam life in front of the mirror
I sat down in my chair and sort of watched him for a while
Hey I said
Dont tell her I got kicked out willya  Okay
That was one good thing about Stradlater
You didnt have to explain every goddam little thing with him the way you had to do with Ackley
Mostly I guess because he wasnt too interested
Thats really why
Ackley it was different
Ackley was a very nosy bastard
He put on my hounds-tooth jacket
Jesus now try not to stretch it all over the place I said
Id only worn it about twice
I wont
Where the hells my cigarettes   On the desk
He never knew where he left anything
Under your muffler
He put them in his coat pocket my coat pocket
I pulled the peak of my hunting hat around to the front all of a sudden for a change
I was getting sort of nervous all of a sudden
Im quite a nervous guy
Listen where ya going on your date with her I asked him
Ya know yet   I dont know
New York if we have time
She only signed out for nine-thirty for Chrissake
I didnt like the way he said it so I said The reason she did that she probably just didnt know what a handsome charming bastard you are
If shed known she probably wouldve signed out for nine-thirty in the morning
Goddam right Stradlater said
You couldnt rile him too easily
He was too conceited
No kidding now
Do that composition for me he said
He had his coat on and he was all ready to go
Dont knock yourself out or anything but just make it descriptive as hell
Okay   I didnt answer him
I didnt feel like it
All I said was Ask her if she still keeps all her kings in the back row
Okay Stradlater said but I knew he wouldnt
Take it easy now
He banged the hell out of the room
I sat there for about a half hour after he left
I mean I just sat in my chair not doing anything
I kept thinking about Jane and about Stradlater having a date with her and all
It made me so nervous I nearly went crazy
I already told you what a sexy bastard Stradlater was
All of a sudden Ackley barged back in again through the damn shower curtains as usual
For once in my stupid life I was really glad to see him
He took my mind off the other stuff
He stuck around till around dinnertime talking about all the guys at Pencey that he hated their guts and squeezing this big pimple on his chin
He didnt even use his handkerchief
I dont even think the bastard had a handkerchief if you want to know the truth
I never saw him use one anyway
We always had the same meal on Saturday nights at Pencey
It was supposed to be a big deal because they gave you steak
Ill bet a thousand bucks the reason they did that was because a lot of guys parents came up to school on Sunday and old Thurmer probably figured everybodys mother would ask their darling boy what he had for dinner last night and hed say Steak
What a racket
You shouldve seen the steaks
They were these little hard dry jobs that you could hardly even cut
You always got these very lumpy mashed potatoes on steak night and for dessert you got Brown Betty which nobody ate except maybe the little kids in the lower school that didnt know any better and guys like Ackley that ate everything
It was nice though when we got out of the dining room
There were about three inches of snow on the ground and it was still coming down like a madman
It looked pretty as hell and we all started throwing snowballs and horsing around all over the place
It was very childish but everybody was really enjoying themselves
I didnt have a date or anything so I and this friend of mine Mal Brossard that was on the wrestling team decided wed take a bus into Agerstown and have a hamburger and maybe see a lousy movie
Neither of us felt like sitting around on our ass all night
I asked Mal if he minded if Ackley came along with us
The reason I asked was because Ackley never did anything on Saturday night except stay in his room and squeeze his pimples or something
Mal said he didnt mind but that he wasnt too crazy about the idea
He didnt like Ackley much
Anyway we both went to our rooms to get ready and all and while I was putting on my galoshes and crap I yelled over and asked old Ackley if he wanted to go to the movies
He could hear me all right through the shower curtains but he didnt answer me right away
He was the kind of a guy that hates to answer you right away
Finally he came over through the goddam curtains and stood on the shower ledge and asked who was going besides me
He always had to know who was going
I swear if that guy was shipwrecked somewhere and you rescued him in a goddam boat hed want to know who the guy was that was rowing it before hed even get in
I told him Mal Brossard was going
He said That bastard 
All right
Wait a second
Youd think he was doing you a big favor
It took him about five hours to get ready
While he was doing it I went over to my window and opened it and packed a snowball with my bare hands
The snow was very good for packing
I didnt throw it at anything though
I started to throw it
At a car that was parked across the street
But I changed my mind
The car looked so nice and white
Then I started to throw it at a hydrant but that looked too nice and white too
Finally I didnt throw it at anything
All I did was close the window and walk around the room with the snowball packing it harder
A little while later I still had it with me when I and Brossnad and Ackley got on the bus
The bus driver opened the doors and made me throw it out
I told him I wasnt going to chuck it at anybody but he wouldnt believe me
People never believe you
Brossard and Ackley both had seen the picture that was playing so all we did we just had a couple of hamburgers and played the pinball machine for a little while then took the bus back to Pencey
I didnt care about not seeing the movie anyway
It was supposed to be a comedy with Cary Grant in it and all that crap
Besides Id been to the movies with Brossard and Ackley before
They both laughed like hyenas at stuff that wasnt even funny
I didnt even enjoy sitting next to them in the movies
It was only about a quarter to nine when we got back to the dorm
Old Brossard was a bridge fiend and he started looking around the dorm for a game
Old Ackley parked himself in my room just for a change
Only instead of sitting on the arm of Stradlaters chair he laid down on my bed with his face right on my pillow and all
He started talking in this very monotonous voice and picking at all his pimples
I dropped about a thousand hints but I couldnt get rid of him
All he did was keep talking in this very monotonous voice about some babe he was supposed to have had sexual intercourse with the summer before
Hed already told me about it about a hundred times
Every time he told it it was different
One minute hed be giving it to her in his cousins Buick the next minute hed be giving it to her under some boardwalk
It was all a lot of crap
naturally
He was a virgin if ever I saw one
I doubt if he ever even gave anybody a feel
Anyway finally I had to come right out and tell him that I had to write a composition for Stradlater and that he had to clear the hell out so I could concentrate
He finally did but he took his time about it as usual
After he left I put on my pajamas and bathrobe and my old hunting hat and started writing the composition
The thing was I couldnt think of a room or a house or anything to describe the way Stradlater said he had to have
Im not too crazy about describing rooms and houses anyway
So what I did I wrote about my brother Allies baseball mitt
It was a very descriptive subject
It really was
My brother Allie had this left-handed fielders mitt
He was left-handed
The thing that was descriptive about it though was that he had poems written all over the fingers and the pocket and everywhere
In green ink
He wrote them on it so that hed have something to read when he was in the field and nobody was up at bat
Hes dead now
He got leukemia and died when we were up in Maine on July 18 1946
Youd have liked him
He was two years younger than I was but he was about fifty times as intelligent
He was terrifically intelligent
His teachers were always writing letters to my mother telling her what a pleasure it was having a boy like Allie in their class
And they werent just shooting the crap
They really meant it
But it wasnt just that he was the most intelligent member in the family
He was also the nicest in lots of ways
He never got mad at anybody
People with red hair are supposed to get mad very easily but Allie never did and he had very red hair
Ill tell you what kind of red hair he had
I started playing golf when I was only ten years old
I remember once the summer I was around twelve teeing off and all and having a hunch that if I turned around all of a sudden Id see Allie
So I did and sure enough he was sitting on his bike outside the fence there was this fence that went all around the course and he was sitting there about a hundred and fifty yards behind me watching me tee off
Thats the kind of red hair he had
God he was a nice kid though
He used to laugh so hard at something he thought of at the dinner table that he just about fell off his chair
I was only thirteen and they were going to have me psychoanalyzed and all because I broke all the windows in the garage
I dont blame them
I really dont
I slept in the garage the night he died and I broke all the goddam windows with my fist just for the hell of it
I even tried to break all the windows on the station wagon we had that summer but my hand was already broken and everything by that time and I couldnt do it
It was a very stupid thing to do Ill admit but I hardly didnt even know I was doing it and you didnt know Allie
My hand still hurts me once in a while when it rains and all and I cant make a real fist any more not a tight one I mean but outside of that I dont care much
I mean Im not going to be a goddam surgeon or a violinist or anything anyway
Anyway thats what I wrote Stradlaters composition about
Old Allies baseball mitt
I happened to have it with me in my suitcase so I got it out and copied down the poems that were written on it
All I had to do was change Allies name so that nobody would know it was my brother and not Stradlaters
I wasnt too crazy about doing it but I couldnt think of anything else descriptive
Besides I sort of liked writing about it
It took me about an hour because I had to use Stradlaters lousy typewriter and it kept jamming on me
The reason I didnt use my own was because Id lent it to a guy down the hall
It was around ten-thirty I guess when I finished it
I wasnt tired though so I looked out the window for a while
It wasnt snowing out any more but every once in a while you could hear a car somewhere not being able to get started
You could also hear
old Ackley snoring
Right through the goddam shower curtains you could hear him
He had sinus trouble and he couldnt breathe too hot when he was asleep
That guy had just about everything
Sinus trouble pimples lousy teeth halitosis crumby fingernails
You had to feel a little sorry for the crazy sonuvabitch
Some things are hard to remember
Im thinking now of when Stradlater got back from his date with Jane
I mean I cant remember exactly what I was doing when I heard his goddam stupid footsteps coming down the corridor
I probably was still looking out the window but I swear I cant remember
I was so damn worried thats why
When I really worry about something I dont just fool around
I even have to go to the bathroom when I worry about something
Only I dont go
Im too worried to go
I dont want to interrupt my worrying to go
If you knew Stradlater youd have been worried too
Id double-dated with that bastard a couple of times and I know what Im talking about
He was unscrupulous
He really was
Anyway the corridor was all linoleum and all and you could hear his goddam footsteps coming right towards the room
I dont even remember where I was sitting when he came in at the window or in my chair or his
I swear I cant remember
He came in griping about how cold it was out
Then he said Where the hell is everybody Its like a goddam morgue around here
I didnt even bother to answer him
If he was so goddam stupid not to realize it was Saturday night and everybody was out or asleep or home for the week end I wasnt going to break my neck telling him
He started getting undressed
He didnt say one goddam word about Jane
Not one
Neither did I
I just watched him
All he did was thank me for letting him wear my hounds-tooth
He hung it up on a hanger and put it in the closet
Then when he was taking off his tie he asked me if Id written his goddam composition for him
I told him it was over on his goddam bed
He walked over and read it while he was unbuttoning his shirt
He stood there reading it and sort of stroking his bare chest and stomach with this very stupid expression on his face
He was always stroking his stomach or his chest
He was mad about himself
All of a sudden he said For Chrissake Holden
This is about a goddam baseball glove
So what I said
Cold as hell
Wuddaya mean so what I told ya it had to be about a goddam room or a house or something
You said it had to be descriptive
What the hells the difference if its about a baseball glove   God damn it
He was sore as hell
He was really furious
You always do everything backasswards
He looked at me
No wonder youre flunking the hell out of here he said
You dont do one damn thing the way youre supposed to
I mean it
Not one damn thing
All right give it back to me then I said
I went over and pulled it right out of his goddam hand
Then I tore it up
What the hellja do that for he said
I didnt even answer him
I just threw the pieces in the wastebasket
Then I lay down on my bed and we both didnt say anything for a long time
He got all undressed down to his shorts and I lay on my bed and lit a cigarette
You werent allowed to smoke in the dorm but you could do it late at night when everybody was asleep or out and nobody could smell the smoke
Besides I did it to annoy Stradlater
It drove him crazy when you broke any rules
He never smoked in the dorm
It was only me
He still didnt say one single solitary word about Jane
So finally I said Youre back pretty goddam late if she only signed out for nine-thirty
Did you make her be late signing in   He was sitting on the edge of his bed cutting his goddam toenails when I asked him that
Coupla minutes he said
Who the hell signs out for nine-thirty on a Saturday night God how I hated him
Did you go to New York I said
Ya crazy How the hell could we go to New York if she only signed out for nine-thirty  Thats tough
He looked up at me
Listen he said if youre gonna smoke in the room how bout going down to the can and do it You may be getting the hell out of here but I have to stick around long enough to graduate
I ignored him
I really did
I went right on smoking like a madman
All I did was sort of turn over on my side and watched him cut his damn toenails
What a school
You were always watching somebody cut their damn toenails or squeeze their pimples or something
Did you give her my regards I asked him
Yeah
The hell he did the bastard
Whatd she say I said
Did you ask her if she still keeps all her kings in the back row   No I didnt ask her
What the hell ya think we did all night play checkers for Chrissake   I didnt even answer him
God how I hated him
If you didnt go to New York whered ya go with her I asked him after a little while
I could hardly keep my voice from shaking all over the place
Boy was I getting nervous
I just had a feeling something had gone funny
He was finished cutting his damn toenails
So he got up from the bed in just his damn shorts and all and started getting very damn playful
He came over to my bed and started leaning over me and taking these playful as hell socks at my shoulder
Cut it out I said
Whered you go with her if you didnt go to New York   Nowhere
We just sat in the goddam car
He gave me another one of those playtul stupid little socks on the shoulder
Cut it out I said
Whose car  Ed Bankys
Ed Banky was the basketball coach at Pencey
Old Stradlater was one of his pets because he was the center on the team and Ed Banky always let him borrow his car when he wanted it
It wasnt allowed for students to borrow faculty guys cars but all the
athletic bastards stuck together
In every school Ive gone to all the athletic bastards stick together
Stradlater kept taking these shadow punches down at my shoulder
He had his toothbrush in his hand and he put it in his mouth
Whatd you do I said
Give her the time in Ed Bankys goddam car My voice was shaking something awful
What a thing to say
Want me to wash your mouth out with soap  Did you   Thats a professional secret buddy
This next part I dont remember so hot
All I know is I got up from the bed like I was going down to the can or something and then I tried to sock him with all my might right smack in the toothbrush so it would split his goddam throat open
Only I missed
I didnt connect
All I did was sort of get him on the side of the head or something
It probably hurt him a little bit but not as much as I wanted
It probably wouldve hurt him a lot but I did it with my right hand and I cant make a good fist with that hand
On account of that injury I told you about
Anyway the next thing I knew I was on the goddam floor and he was sitting on my chest with his face all red
That is he had his goddam knees on my chest and he weighed about a ton
He had hold of my wrists too so I couldnt take another sock at him
Idve killed him
What the hells the matter with you he kept saying and his stupid race kept getting redder and redder
Get your lousy knees off my chest I told him
I was almost bawling
I really was
Go on get off a me ya crumby bastard
He wouldnt do it though
He kept holding onto my wrists and I kept calling him a sonuvabitch and all for around ten hours
I can hardly even remember what all I said to him
I told him he thought he could give the time to anybody he felt like
I told him he didnt even care if a girl kept all her kings in the back row or not and the reason he didnt care was because he was a goddam stupid moron
He hated it when you called a moron
All morons hate it when you call them a moron
Shut up now Holden he said with his big stupid red face
just shut up now
You dont even know if her first name is Jane or Jean ya goddam moron   Now shut up Holden God damn it Im warning ya he said I really had him going
If you dont shut up Im gonna slam ya one
Get your dirty stinking moron knees off my chest
If I letcha up will you keep your mouth shut   I didnt even answer him
He said it over again
Holden
If I letcha up willya keep your mouth shut  Yes
He got up off me and I got up too
My chest hurt like hell from his dirty knees
Youre a dirty stupid sonuvabitch of a moron I told him
That got him really mad
He shook his big stupid finger in my face
Holden God damn it Im warning you now
For the last time
If you dont keep your yap shut Im gonna    Why should I I said I was practically yelling
Thats just the trouble with all you morons
You never want to discuss anything
Thats the way you can always tell a moron
They never want to discuss anything intellig 
Then he really let one go at me and the next thing I knew I was on the goddam floor again
I dont remember if he knocked me out or not but I dont think so
Its pretty hard to knock a guy out except in the goddam movies
But my nose was bleeding all over the place
When I looked up old Stradlater was standing practically right on top of me
He had his goddam toilet kit under his arm
Why the hell dontcha shut up when I tellya to he said
He sounded pretty nervous
He probably was scared hed fractured my skull or something when I hit the floor
Its too bad I didnt
You asked for it God damn it he said
Boy did he look worried
I didnt even bother to get up
I just lay there in the floor for a while and kept calling him a moron sonuvabitch
I was so mad I was practically bawling
Listen
Go wash your face Stradlater said
Ya hear me   I told him to go wash his own moron face which was a pretty childish thing to say but I was mad as hell
I told him to stop off on the way to the can and give Mrs Schmidt the time
Mrs Schmidt was the janitors wife
She was around sixty-five
I kept sitting there on the floor till I heard old Stradlater close the door and go down the corridor to the can
Then I got up
I couldnt find my goddam hunting hat anywhere
Finally I found it
It was under the bed
I put it on and turned the old peak around to the back the way I liked it and then I went over and took a look at my stupid face in the mirror
You never saw such gore in your life
I had blood all over my mouth and chin and even on my pajamas and bath robe
It partly scared me and it partly fascinated me
All that blood and all sort of made me look tough
Id only been in about two fights in my life and I lost both of them
Im not too tough
Im a pacifist if you want to know the truth
I had a feeling old Ackleyd probably heard all the racket and was awake
So I went through the shower curtains into his room just to see what the hell he was doing
I hardly ever went over to his room
It always had a funny stink in it because he was so crumby in his personal habits
A tiny bit of light came through the shower curtains and all from our room and I could see him lying in bed
I knew damn well he was wide awake
Ackley I said
Yawake  Yeah
It was pretty dark and I stepped on somebodys shoe on the floor and danm near fell on my head
Ackley sort of sat up in bed and leaned on his arm
He had a lot of white stuff on his face for his pimples
He looked sort of spooky in the dark
What the hellya doing anyway I said
Wuddaya mean what the hell am I doing I was tryna sleep before you guys started making all that noise
What the hell was the fight about anyhow   Wheres the light I couldnt find the light
I was sliding my hand all over the wall
Wuddaya want the light for 
Right next to your hand
I finally found the switch and turned It on
Old Ackley put his hand up so the light wouldnt hurt his eyes
Jesus he said
What the hell happened to you He meant all the blood and all
I had a little goddam tiff with Stradlater I said
Then I sat down on the floor
They never had any chairs in their room
I dont know what the hell they did with their chairs
Listen I said do you feel like playing a little Canasta He was a Canasta fiend
Youre still bleeding for Chrissake
You better put something on it
Itll stop
Listen
Ya wanna play a little Canasta or dontcha   Canasta for Chrissake
Do you know what time it is by any chance   It isnt late
Its only around eleven eleven-thirty
Only around Ackley said
Listen
I gotta get up and go to Mass in the morning for Chrissake
You guys start hollering and fighting in the middle of the goddam What the hell was the fight about anyhow    Its a long story
I dont wanna bore ya Ackley
Im thinking of your welfare I told him
I never discussed my personal life with him
In the first place he was even more stupid than Stradlater
Stradlater was a goddam genius next to Ackley
Hey I said is it okay if I sleep in Elys bed tonight He wont be back till tomorrow night will he I knew damn well he wouldnt
Ely went home damn near every week end
I dont know when the hell hes coming back Ackley said
Boy did that annoy me
What the hell do you mean you dont know when hes coming back He never comes back till Sunday night does he   No but for Chrissake I cant just tell somebody they can sleep in his goddam bed if they want to
That killed me
I reached up from where I was sitting on the floor and patted him on the goddam shoulder
Youre a prince Ackley kid I said
You know that   No I mean it I cant just tell somebody they can sleep in    Youre a real prince
Youre a gentleman and a scholar kid I said
He really was too
Do you happen to have any cigarettes by any chance Say no or Ill drop dead
No I dont as a matter of fact
Listen what the hell was the fight about   I didnt answer him
All I did was I got up and went over and looked out the window
I felt so lonesome all of a sudden
I almost wished I was dead
What the hell was the fight about anyhow Ackley said for about the fiftieth time
He certainly was a bore about that
About you I said
About me for Chrissake   Yeah
I was defending your goddam honor
Stradlater said you had a lousy personality
I couldnt let him get away with that stuff
That got him excited
He did No kidding He did   I told him I was only kidding and then I went over and laid down on Elys bed
Boy did I feel rotten
I felt so damn lonesome
This room stinks I said
I can smell your socks from way over here
Dontcha ever send them to the laundry   If you dont like it you know what you can do Ackley said
What a witty guy
How bout turning off the goddam light   I didnt turn it off right away though
I just kept laying there on Elys bed thinking about Jane and all
It just drove me stark staring mad when I thought about her
and Stradlater parked somewhere in that fat-assed Ed Bankys car
Every time I thought about it I felt like jumping out the window
The thing is you didnt know Stradlater
I knew him
Most guys at Pencey just talked about having sexual intercourse with girls all the time like Ackley for instance but old Stradlater really did it
I was personally acquainted with at least two girls he gave the time to
Thats the truth
Tell me the story of your fascinating life Ackley kid I said
How bout turning off the goddam light I gotta get up for Mass in the morning
I got up and turned it off if it made him happy
Then I laid down on Elys bed again
Whatre ya gonna do sleep in Elys bed Ackley said
He was the perfect host boy
I may
I may not
Dont worry about it
Im not worried about it
Only Id hate like hell if Ely came in all of a sudden and found some guy    Relax
Im not gonna sleep here
I wouldnt abuse your goddam hospitality
A couple of minutes later he was snoring like mad
I kept laying there in the dark anyway though trying not to think about old Jane and Stradlater in that goddam Ed Bankys car
But it was almost impossible
The trouble was I knew that guy Stradlaters technique
That made it even worse
We once double-dated in Ed Bankys car and Stradlater was in the back with his date and I was in the front with mine
What a technique that guy had
What hed do was hed start snowing his date in this very quiet sincere voice like as if he wasnt only a very handsome guy but a nice sincere guy too
I damn near puked listening to him
His date kept saying No please
Please dont
Please
But old Stradlater kept snowing her in this Abraham Lincoln sincere voice and finally thered be this terrific silence in the back of the car
It was really embarrassing
I dont think he gave that girl the time that night but damn near
Damn near
While I was laying there trying not to think I heard old Stradlater come back from the can and go in our room
You could hear him putting away his crumby toilet articles and all and opening the window
He was a fresh-air fiend
Then a little while later he turned off the light
He didnt even look around to see where I was at
It was even depressing out in the street
You couldnt even hear any cars any more
I got feeling so lonesome and rotten I even felt like waking Ackley up
Hey Ackley I said in sort of a whisper so Stradlater couldnt hear me through the shower curtain
Ackley didnt hear me though
Hey Ackley   He still didnt hear me
He slept like a rock
Hey Ackley   He heard that all right
What the hells the matter with you he said
I was asleep for Chrissake
Listen
Whats the routine on joining a monastery I asked him
I was sort of toying with the idea of joining one
Do you have to be a Catholic and all   Certainly you have to be a Catholic
You bastard did you wake me just to ask me a dumb ques 
Aah go back to sleep
Im not gonna join one anyway
The kind of luck I have Id probably join one with all the wrong kind of monks in it
All stupid bastards
Or just bastards
When I said that old Ackley sat way the hell up in bed
Listen he said I dont care what you say about me or anything but if you start making cracks about my goddam religion for Chrissake    Relax I said
Nobodys making any cracks about your goddam religion
I got up off Elys bed and started towards the door
I didnt want to hang around in that stupid atmosphere any more
I stopped on the way though and picked up Ackleys hand and gave him a big phony handshake
He pulled it away from me
Whats the idea he said
No idea
I just want to thank you for being such a goddam prince thats all I said
I said it in this very sincere voice
Youre aces Ackley kid I said
You know that   Wise guy
Someday somebodys gonna bash your    I didnt even bother to listen to him
I shut the damn door and went out in the corridor
Everybody was asleep or out or home for the week end and it was very very quiet and depressing in the corridor
There was this empty box of Kolynos toothpaste outside Leahy and Hoffmans door and while I walked down towards the stairs I kept giving it a boot with this sheep-lined slipper I had on
What I thought Id do I thought I might go down and see what old Mal Brossard was doing
But all of a sudden I changed my mind
All of a sudden I decided what Id really do Id get the hell out of Pencey right that same night and all
I mean not wait till Wednesday or anything
I just didnt want to hang around any more
It made me too sad and lonesome
So what I decided to do I decided Id take a room in a hotel in New York some very inexpensive hotel and all and just take it easy till Wednesday
Then on Wednesday Id go home all rested up and feeling swell
I figured my parents probably wouldnt get old Thurmers letter saying Id been given the ax till maybe Tuesday or Wednesday
I didnt want to go home or anything till they got it and thoroughly digested it and all
I didnt want to be around when they first got it
My mother gets very hysterical
Shes not too bad after she gets something thoroughly digested though
Besides I sort of needed a little vacation
My nerves were shot
They really were
Anyway thats what I decided Id do
So I went back to the room and turned on the light to start packing and all
I already had quite a few things packed
Old Stradlater didnt even wake up
I lit a cigarette and got all dressed and then I packed these two Gladstones I have
It only took me about two minutes
Im a very rapid packer
One thing about packing depressed me a little
I had to pack these brand-new ice skates my mother had practically just sent me a couple of days before
That depressed me
I could see my mother going in Spauldings and asking the salesman a million dopy questions and here I was getting the ax again
It made me feel pretty sad
She bought me the wrong kind of skates I wanted racing skates and she bought hockey but it made me sad anyway
Almost every time somebody gives me a present it ends up making me sad
After I got all packed I sort of counted my dough
I dont remember exactly how much I had but I was pretty loaded
My grandmotherd just sent me a wad about a week before
I have this grandmother thats quite lavish with her dough
She doesnt have all her marbles any more shes old as hell and she keeps sending me money for my
birthday about four times a year
Anyway even though I was pretty loaded I figured I could always use a few extra bucks
You never know
So what I did was I went down the hail and woke up Frederick Woodruff this guy Id lent my typewriter to
I asked him how much hed give me for it
He was a pretty wealthy guy
He said he didnt know
He said he didnt much want to buy it
Finally he bought it though
It cost about ninety bucks and all he bought it for was twenty
He was sore because Id woke him up
When I was all set to go when I had my bags and all I stood for a while next to the stairs and took a last look down the goddam corridor
I was sort of crying
I dont know why
I put my red hunting hat on and turned the peak around to the back the way I liked it and then I yelled at the top of my goddam voice Sleep tight ya morons Ill bet I woke up every bastard on the whole floor
Then I got the hell out
Some stupid guy had thrown peanut shells all over the stairs and I damn near broke my crazy neck
It was too late to call up for a cab or anything so I walked the whole way to the station
It wasnt too far but it was cold as hell and the snow made it hard for walking and my Gladstones kept banging hell out of my legs
I sort of enjoyed the air and all though
The only trouble was the cold made my nose hurt and right under my upper lip where old Stradlaterd laid one on me
Hed smacked my lip right on my teeth and it was pretty sore
My ears were nice and warm though
That hat I bought had earlaps in it and I put them on I didnt give a damn how I looked
Nobody was around anyway
Everybody was in the sack
I was quite lucky when I got to the station because I only had to wait about ten minutes for a train
While I waited I got some snow in my hand and washed my face with it
I still had quite a bit of blood on
Usually I like riding on trains especially at night with the lights on and the windows so black and one of those guys coming up the aisle selling coffee and sandwiches and magazines
I usually buy a ham sandwich and about four magazines
If Im on a train at night I can usually even read one of those dumb stories in a magazine without puking
You know
One of those stories with a lot of phony lean-jawed guys named David in it and a lot of phony girls named Linda or Marcia that are always lighting all the goddam Davids pipes for them
I can even read one of those lousy stories on a train at night usually
But this time it was different
I just didnt feel like it
I just sort of sat and not did anything
All I did was take off my hunting hat and put it in my pocket
All of a sudden this lady got on at Trenton and sat down next to me
Practically the whole car was empty because it was pretty late and all but she sat down next to me instead of an empty seat because she had this big bag with her and I was sitting in the front seat
She stuck the bag right out in the middle of the aisle where the conductor and everybody could trip over it
She had these orchids on like shed just been to a big party or something
She was around forty or forty-five I guess but she was very good looking
Women kill me
They really do
I dont mean Im oversexed or anything like that although I am quite sexy
I just like them I mean
Theyre always leaving their goddam bags out in the middle of the aisle
Anyway we were sitting there and all of a sudden she said to me Excuse me but isnt that a Pencey Prep sticker She was looking up at my suitcases up on the rack
Yes it is I said
She was right
I did have a goddam Pencey sticker on one of my Gladstones
Very corny Ill admit
Oh do you go to Pencey she said
She had a nice voice
A nice telephone voice mostly
She shouldve carried a goddam telephone around with her
Yes I do I said
Oh how lovely Perhaps you know my son then Ernest Morrow He goes to Pencey
Yes I do
Hes in my class
Her son was doubtless the biggest bastard that ever went to Pencey in the whole crumby history of the school
He was always going down the corridor after hed had a shower snapping his soggy old wet towel at peoples asses
Thats exactly the kind of a guy he was
Oh how nice the lady said
But not corny
She was just nice and all
I must tell Ernest we met she said
May I ask your name dear   Rudolf Schmidt I told her
I didnt feel like giving her my whole life history
Rudolf Schmidt was the name of the janitor of our dorm
Do you like Pencey she asked me
Pencey Its not too bad
Its not paradise or anything but its as good as most schools
Some of the faculty are pretty conscientious
Ernest just adores it
I know he does I said
Then I started shooting the old crap around a little bit
He adapts himself very well to things
He really does
I mean he really knows how to adapt himself
Do you think so she asked me
She sounded interested as hell
Ernest Sure I said
Then I watched her take off her gloves
Boy was she lousy with rocks
I just broke a nail getting out of a cab she said
She looked up at me and sort of smiled
She had a terrifically nice smile
She really did
Most people have hardly any smile at all or a lousy one
Ernests father and I sometimes worry about him she said
We sometimes feel hes not a terribly good mixer
How do you mean   Well
Hes a very sensitive boy
Hes really never been a terribly good mixer with other boys
Perhaps he takes things a little more seriously than he should at his age
Sensitive
That killed me
That guy Morrow was about as sensitive as a goddam toilet seat
I gave her a good look
She didnt look like any dope to me
She looked like she might have a pretty damn good idea what a bastard she was the mother of
But you cant always tell with somebodys mother I mean
Mothers are all slightly insane
The thing is though I liked old Morrows mother
She was all right
Would you care for a cigarette I asked her
She looked all around
I dont believe this is a smoker Rudolf she said
Rudolf
That killed me
Thats all right
We can smoke till they start screaming at us I said
She took a cigarette off me and I gave her a light
She looked nice smoking
She inhaled and all but she didnt wolf the smoke down the way most women around her age do
She had a lot of charm
She had  quite a lot of sex appeal too if you really want to know
She was looking at me sort of funny
I may be wrong but I believe your nose is bleeding dear she said all of a sudden
I nodded and took out my handkerchief
I got hit with a snowball I said
One of those very icy ones
I probably wouldve told her what really happened but it wouldve taken too long
I liked her though
I was beginning to feel sort of sorry Id told her my name was Rudolf Schmidt
Old Ernie I said
Hes one of the most popular boys at Pencey
Did you know that   No I didnt
I nodded
It really took everybody quite a long time to get to know him
Hes a funny guy
A strange guy in lots of ways know what I mean Like when I first met him
When I first met him I thought he was kind of a snobbish person
Thats what I thought
But he isnt
Hes just got this very original personality that takes you a little while to get to know him
Old Mrs Morrow didnt say anything but boy you shouldve seen her
I had her glued to her seat
You take somebodys mother all they want to hear about is what a hot-shot their son is
Then I really started chucking the old crap around
Did he tell you about the elections I asked her
The class elections   She shook her head
I had her in a trance like
I really did
Well a bunch of us wanted old Ernie to be president of the class
I mean he was the unanimous choice
I mean he was the only boy that could really handle the job I said boy was I chucking it
But this other boy Harry Fencer was elected
And the reason he was elected the simple and obvious reason was because Ernie wouldnt let us nominate him
Because hes so darn shy and modest and all
He refused
Boy hes really shy
You oughta make him try to get over that
I looked at her
Didnt he tell you about it   No he didnt
I nodded
Thats Ernie
He wouldnt
Thats the one fault with him hes too shy and modest
You really oughta get him to try to relax occasionally
Right that minute the conductor came around for old Mrs Morrows ticket and it gave me a chance to quit shooting it
Im glad I shot it for a while though
You take a guy like Morrow thats always snapping their towel at peoples asses really trying to hurt somebody with it they dont just stay a rat while theyre a kid
They stay a rat their whole life
But Ill bet after all the crap I shot Mrs Morrowll keep thinking of him now as this very shy modest guy that wouldnt let us nominate him for president
She might
You cant tell
Mothers arent too sharp about that stuff
Would you care for a cocktail I asked her
I was feeling in the mood for one myself
We can go in the club car
All right   Dear are you allowed to order drinks she asked me
Not snotty though
She was too charming and all to be snotty
Well no not exactly but I can usually get them on account of my heighth I said
And I have quite a bit of gray hair
I turned sideways and showed her my gray
hair
It fascinated hell out of her
Cmon join me why dont you I said
Idve enjoyed having her
I really dont think Id better
Thank you so much though dear she said
Anyway the club cars most likely closed
Its quite late you know
She was right
Id forgotten all about what time it was
Then she looked at me and asked me what I was afraid she was going to ask me
Ernest wrote that hed be home on Wednesday that Christmas vacation would start on Wednesday she said
I hope you werent called home suddenly because of illness in the family
She really looked worried about it
She wasnt just being nosy you could tell
No everybodys fine at home I said
Its me
I have to have this operation
Oh Im so sorry she said
She really was too
I was right away sorry Id said it but it was too late
It isnt very serious
I have this tiny little tumor on the brain
Oh no She put her hand up to her mouth and all
Oh Ill be all right and everything Its right near the outside
And its a very tiny one
They can take it out in about two minutes
Then I started reading this timetable I had in my pocket
Just to stop lying
Once I get started I can go on for hours if I feel like it
No kidding
Hours
We didnt talk too much after that
She started reading this Vogue she had with her and I looked out the window for a while
She got off at Newark
She wished me a lot of luck with the operation and all
She kept calling me Rudolf
Then she invited me to visit Ernie during the summer at Gloucester Massachusetts
She said their house was right on the beach and they had a tennis court and all but I just thanked her and told her I was going to South America with my grandmother
Which was really a hot one because my grandmother hardly ever even goes out of the house except maybe to go to a goddam matinee or something
But I wouldnt visit that sonuvabitch Morrow for all the dough in the world even if I was desperate
The first thing I did when I got off at Penn Station I went into this phone booth
I felt like giving somebody a buzz
I left my bags right outside the booth so that I could watch them but as soon as I was inside I couldnt think of anybody to call up
My brother DB was in Hollywood
My kid sister Phoebe goes to bed around nine oclock so I couldnt call her up
She wouldntve cared if Id woke her up but the trouble was she wouldntve been the one that answered the phone
My parents would be the ones
So that was out
Then I thought of giving Jane Gallaghers mother a buzz and find out when Janes vacation started but I didnt feel like it
Besides it was pretty late to call up
Then I thought of calling this girl I used to go around with quite frequently Sally Hayes because I knew her Christmas vacation had started already shed written me this long phony letter inviting me over to help her trim the Christmas tree Christmas Eve and all but I was afraid her motherd answer the phone
Her mother knew my mother and I could picture her breaking a goddam leg to get to the phone and tell my mother I was in New York
Besides I wasnt crazy about talking to old Mrs Hayes on the phone
She once told Sally I was wild
She said I was wild and that I had no direction in life
Then I thought of
calling up this guy that went to the Whooton School when I was there Carl Luce but I didnt like him much
So I ended up not calling anybody
I came out of the booth after about twenty minutes or so and got my bags and walked over to that tunnel where the cabs are and got a cab
Im so damn absent-minded I gave the driver my regular address just out of habit and all I mean I completely forgot I was going to shack up in a hotel for a couple of days and not go home till vacation started
I didnt think of it till we were halfway through the park
Then I said Hey do you mind turning around when you get a chance I gave you the wrong address
I want to go back downtown
The driver was sort of a wise guy
I cant turn around here Mac
This heres a one-way
Ill have to go all the way to Ninedieth Street now
I didnt want to start an argument
Okay I said
Then I thought of something all of a sudden
Hey listen I said
You know those ducks in that lagoon right near Central Park South That little lake By any chance do you happen to know where they go the ducks when it gets all frozen over Do you happen to know by any chance I realized it was only one chance in a million
He turned around and looked at me like I was a madman
Whatre ya tryna do bud he said
Kid me   No I was just interested thats all
He didnt say anything more so I didnt either
Until we came out of the park at Ninetieth Street
Then he said All right buddy
Where to   Well the thing is I dont want to stay at any hotels on the East Side where I might run into some acquaintances of mine
Im traveling incognito I said
I hate saying corny things like traveling incognito
But when Im with somebody thats corny I always act corny too
Do you happen to know whose bands at the Taft or the New Yorker by any chance   No idear Mac
Well take me to the Edmont then I said
Would you care to stop on the way and join me for a cocktail On me
Im loaded
Cant do it Mac
Sorry
He certainly was good company
Terrific personality
We got to the Edmont Hotel and I checked in
Id put on my red hunting cap when I was in the cab just for the hell of it but I took it off before I checked in
I didnt want to look like a screwball or something
Which is really ironic
I didnt know then that the goddam hotel was full of perverts and morons
Screwballs all over the place
They gave me this very crumby room with nothing to look out of the window at except the other side of the hotel
I didnt care much
I was too depressed to care whether I had a good view or not
The bellboy that showed me to the room was this very old guy around sixty-five
He was even more depressing than the room was
He was one of those bald guys that comb all their hair over from the side to cover up the baldness
Id rather be bald than do that
Anyway what a gorgeous job for a guy around sixty-five years old
Carrying peoples suitcases and waiting around for a tip
I suppose he wasnt too intelligent or anything but it was terrible anyway
After he left I looked out the window for a while with my coat on and all
I didnt have anything else to do
Youd be surprised what was going on on the other side of the hotel
They didnt even bother to pull their shades down
I saw one guy a gray-haired very distinguished-looking guy with only his shorts on do something you wouldnt
believe me if I told you
First he put his suitcase on the bed
Then he took out all these womens clothes and put them on
Real womens clothes silk stockings high-heeled shoes brassiere and one of those corsets with the straps hanging down and all
Then he put on this very tight black evening dress
I swear to God
Then he started walking up and down the room taking these very small steps the way a woman does and smoking a cigarette and looking at himself in the mirror
He was all alone too
Unless somebody was in the bathroom I couldnt see that much
Then in the window almost right over his I saw a man and a woman squirting water out of their mouths at each other
It probably was highballs not water but I couldnt see what they had in their glasses
Anyway first hed take a swallow and squirt it all over her then she did it to him they took turns for Gods sake
You shouldve seen them
They were in hysterics the whole time like it was the funniest thing that ever happened
Im not kidding the hotel was lousy with perverts
I was probably the only normal bastard in the whole place and that isnt saying much
I damn near sent a telegram to old Stradlater telling him to take the first train to New York
Hed have been the king of the hotel
The trouble was that kind of junk is sort of fascinating to watch even if you dont want it to be
For instance that girl that was getting water squirted all over her face she was pretty good-looking
I mean thats my big trouble
In my mind Im probably the biggest sex maniac you ever saw
Sometimes I can think of very crumby stuff I wouldnt mind doing if the opportunity came up
I can even see how it might be quite a lot of fun in a crumby way and if you were both sort of drunk and all to get a girl and squirt water or something all over each others face
The thing is though I dont like the idea
It stinks if you analyze it
I think if you dont really like a girl you shouldnt horse around with her at all and if you do like her then youre supposed to like her face and if you like her face you ought to be careful about doing crumby stuff to it like squirting water all over it
Its really too bad that so much crumby stuff is a lot of fun sometimes
Girls arent too much help either when you start trying not to get too crumby when you start trying not to spoil anything really good
I knew this one girl a couple of years ago that was even crumbier than I was
Boy was she crumby We had a lot of fun though for a while in a crumby way
Sex is something I really dont understand too hot
You never know where the hell you are
I keep making up these sex rules for myself and then I break them right away
Last year I made a rule that I was going to quit horsing around with girls that deep down gave me a pain in the ass
I broke it though the same week I made it the same night as a matter of fact
I spent the whole night necking with a terrible phony named Anne Louise Sherman
Sex is something I just dont understand
I swear to God I dont
I started toying with the idea while I kept standing there of giving old Jane a buzz I mean calling her long distance at B
M
where she went instead of calling up her mother to find out when she was coming home
You werent supposed to call students up late at night but I had it all figured out
I was going to tell whoever answered the phone that I was her uncle
I was going to say her aunt had just got killed in a car accident and I had to speak to her immediately
It wouldve worked too
The only reason I didnt do it was because I wasnt in the mood
If youre not in the mood you cant do that stuff right
After a while I sat down in a chair and smoked a couple of cigarettes
I was feeling pretty horny
I have to admit it
Then all of a sudden I got this idea
I took out my wallet and started looking for this address a guy I met at a party last summer that
went to Princeton gave me
Finally I found it
It was all a funny color from my wallet but you could still read it
It was the address of this girl that wasnt exactly a whore or anything but that didnt mind doing it once in a while this Princeton guy told me
He brought her to a dance at Princeton once and they nearly kicked him out for bringing her
She used to be a burlesque stripper or something
Anyway I went over to the phone and gave her a buzz
Her name was Faith Cavendish and she lived at the Stanford Arms Hotel on Sixty-fifth and Broadway
A dump no doubt
For a while I didn t think she was home or something
Nobody kept answering
Then finally somebody picked up the phone
Hello I said
I made my voice quite deep so that she wouldnt suspect my age or anything
I have a pretty deep voice anyway
Hello this womans voice said
None too friendly either
Is this Miss Faith Cavendish   Whos this she said
Whos calling me up at this crazy goddam hour   That sort of scared me a little bit
Well I know its quite late I said in this very mature voice and all
I hope youll forgive me but I was very anxious to get in touch with you
I said it suave as hell
I really did
Who is this she said
Well you dont know me but Im a friend of Eddie Birdsells
He suggested that if I were in town sometime we ought to get together for a cocktail or two
Who Youre a friend of who Boy she was a real tigress over the phone
She was damn near yelling at me
Edmund Birdsell
Eddie Birdsell I said
I couldnt remember if his name was Edmund or Edward
I only met him once at a goddam stupid party
I dont know anybody by that name Jack
And if you think I enjoy bein woke up in the middle    Eddie Birdsell From Princeton I said
You could tell she was running the name over in her mind and all
Birdsell Birdsell
from Princeton
Princeton College   Thats right I said
You from Princeton College  Well approximately
Oh
How is Eddie she said
This is certainly a peculiar time to call a person up though
Jesus Christ
Hes fine
He asked to be remembered to you
Well thank you
Remember me to him she said
Hes a grand person
Whats he doing now She was getting friendly as hell all of a sudden
Oh you know
Same old stuff I said
How the hell did I know what he was doing I hardly knew the guy
I didnt even know if he was still at Princeton
Look I said
Would you be interested in meeting me for a cocktail somewhere   By any chance do you have any idea what time it is she said
Whats your name anyhow may I ask She was getting an English accent all of a sudden
You sound a little on the young side
I laughed
Thank you for the compliment I said  suave as hell
Holden Caulfields my name
I shouldve given her a phony name but I didnt think of it
Well look Mr Cawffle
Im not in the habit of making engagements in the middle of the night
Im a working gal
Tomorrows Sunday I told her
Well anyway
I gotta get my beauty sleep
You know how it is
I thought we might have just one cocktail together
It isnt too late
Well
Youre very sweet she said
Where ya callin from Where ya at now anyways   Me Im in a phone booth
Oh she said
Then there was this very long pause
Well Id like awfully to get together with you sometime Mr Cawffle
You sound very attractive
You sound like a very attractive person
But it is late
I could come up to your place
Well ordinary Id say grand
I mean Id love to have you drop up for a cocktail but my roommate happens to be ill
Shes been laying here all night without a wink of sleep
She just this minute closed her eyes and all
I mean
Oh
Thats too bad
Where ya stopping at Perhaps we could get together for cocktails tomorrow
I cant make it tomorrow I said
Tonights the only time I can make it
What a dope I was
I shouldntve said that
Oh
Well Im awfully sorry
Ill say hello to Eddie for you
Willya do that I hope you enjoy your stay in New York
Its a grand place
I know it is
Thanks
Good night I said
Then I hung up
Boy I really fouled that up
I shouldve at least made it for cocktails or something
It was still pretty early
Im not sure what time it was but it wasnt too late
The one thing I hate to do is go to bed when Im not even tired
So I opened my suitcases and took out a clean shirt and then I went in the bathroom and washed and changed my shirt
What I thought Id do I thought Id go downstairs and see what the hell was going on in the Lavender Room
They had this night club the Lavender Room in the hotel
While I was changing my shirt I damn near gave my kid sister Phoebe a buzz though
I certainly felt like talking to her on the phone
Somebody with sense and all
But I couldnt take a chance on giving her a buzz because she was only a little kid and she wouldnt have been up let alone anywhere near the phone
I thought of maybe hanging up if my parents answered but that wouldntve worked either
Theyd know it was me
My mother always knows its me
Shes psychic
But I certainly wouldnt have minded shooting the crap with old Phoebe for a while
You should see her
You never saw a little kid so pretty and smart in your whole life
Shes really smart
I mean shes had all As ever since she started school
As a matter of fact Im the only dumb one in the family
My brother DBs a writer and all and my brother Allie the one that died that I told you about was a wizard
Im the only really dumb one
But you ought to see old Phoebe
She has this sort of red hair a little bit like Allies was thats very short in the summertime
In the summertime she sticks it behind
her ears
She has nice pretty little ears
In the wintertime its pretty long though
Sometimes my mother braids it and sometimes she doesnt
Its really nice though
Shes only ten
Shes quite skinny like me but nice skinny
Roller-skate skinny
I watched her once from the window when she was crossing over Fifth Avenue to go to the park and thats what she is roller-skate skinny
Youd like her
I mean if you tell old Phoebe something she knows exactly what the hell youre talking about
I mean you can even take her anywhere with you
If you take her to a lousy movie for instance she knows its a lousy movie
If you take her to a pretty good movie she knows its a pretty good movie
DB and I took her to see this French movie The Bakers Wife with Raimu in it
It killed her
Her favorite is The 39 Steps though with Robert Donat
She knows the whole goddam movie by heart because Ive taken her to see it about ten times
When old Donat comes up to this Scotch farmhouse for instance when hes running away from the cops and all Phoebell say right out loud in the movie right when the Scotch guy in the picture says it Can you eat the herring She knows all the talk by heart
And when this professor in the picture thats really a German spy sticks up his little finger with part of the middle joint missing to show Robert Donat old Phoebe beats him to it she holds up her little finger at me in the dark right in front of my face
Shes all right
Youd like her
The only trouble is shes a little too affectionate sometimes
Shes very emotional for a child
She really is
Something else she does she writes books all the time
Only she doesnt finish them
Theyre all about some kid named Hazel Weatherfield only old Phoebe spells it Hazle
Old Hazle Weatherfield is a girl detective
Shes supposed to be an orphan but her old man keeps showing up
Her old mans always a tall attractive gentleman about 20 years of age
That kills me
Old Phoebe
I swear to God youd like her
She was smart even when she was a very tiny little kid
When she was a very tiny little kid I and Allie used to take her to the park with us especially on Sundays
Allie had this sailboat he used to like to fool around with on Sundays and we used to take old Phoebe with us
Shed wear white gloves and walk right between us like a lady and all
And when Allie and I were having some conversation about things in general old Phoebed be listening
Sometimes youd forget she was around because she was such a little kid but shed let you know
Shed interrupt you all the time
Shed give Allie or I a push or something and say Who Who said that Bobby or the lady And wed tell her who said it and shed say Oh and go right on listening and all
She killed Allie too
I mean he liked her too
Shes ten now and not such a tiny little kid any more but she still kills everybody everybody with any sense anyway
Anyway she was somebody you always felt like talking to on the phone
But I was too afraid my parents would answer and then theyd find out I was in New York and kicked out of Pencey and all
So I just finished putting on my shirt
Then I got all ready and went down in the elevator to the lobby to see what was going on
Except for a few pimpy-looking guys and a few whory-looking blondes the lobby was pretty empty
But you could hear the band playing in the Lavender Room and so I went in there
It wasnt very crowded but they gave me a lousy table anyway way in the back
I shouldve waved a buck under the head-waiters nose
In New York boy money really talks Im not kidding
The band was putrid
Buddy Singer
Very brassy but not good brassy corny brassy
Also there were very few people around my age in the place
In fact nobody was around my age
They were mostly old show-offy-looking guys with their dates
Except at
the table right next to me
At the table right next to me there were these three girls around thirty or so
The whole three of them were pretty ugly and they all had on the kind of hats that you knew they didnt really live in New York but one of them the blonde one wasnt too bad
She was sort of cute the blonde one and I started giving her the old eye a little bit but just then the waiter came up for my order
I ordered a Scotch and soda and told him not to mix it I said it fast as hell because if you hem and haw they think youre under twenty-one and wont sell you any intoxicating liquor
I had trouble with him anyway though
Im sorry sir he said but do you have some verification of your age Your drivers license perhaps   I gave him this very cold stare like hed insulted the hell out of me and asked him Do I look like Im under twenty-one   Im sorry sir but we have our    Okay okay I said
I figured the hell with it
Bring me a Coke
He started to go away but I called him back
Cantcha stick a little rum in it or something I asked him
I asked him very nicely and all
I cant sit in a corny place like this cold sober
Cantcha stick a little rum in it or something   Im very sorry sir
he said and beat it on me
I didnt hold it against him though
They lose their jobs if they get caught selling to a minor
Im a goddam minor
I started giving the three witches at the next table the eye again
That is the blonde one
The other two were strictly from hunger
I didnt do it crudely though
I just gave all three of them this very cool glance and all
What they did though the three of them when I did it they started giggling like morons
They probably thought I was too young to give anybody the once-over
That annoyed hell out of me  youdve thought I wanted to marry them or something
I shouldve given them the freeze after they did that but the trouble was I really felt like dancing
Im very fond of dancing sometimes and that was one of the times
So all of a sudden I sort of leaned over and said Would any of you girls care to dance I didnt ask them crudely or anything
Very suave in fact
But God damn it they thought that was a panic too
They started giggling some more
Im not kidding they were three real morons
Cmon I said
Ill dance with you one at a time
All right How bout it Cmon I really felt like dancing
Finally the blonde one got up to dance with me because you could tell I was really talking to her and we walked out to the dance floor
The other two grools nearly had hysterics when we did
I certainly mustve been very hard up to even bother with any of them
But it was worth it
The blonde was some dancer
She was one of the best dancers I ever danced with
Im not kidding some of these very stupid girls can really knock you out on a dance floor
You take a really smart girl and half the time shes trying to lead you around the dance floor or else shes such a lousy dancer the best thing to do is stay at the table and just get drunk with her
You really can dance I told the blonde one
You oughta be a pro
I mean it
I danced with a pro once and youre twice as good as she was
Did you ever hear of Marco and Miranda   What she said
She wasnt even listening to me
She was looking all around the place
I said did you ever hear of Marco and Miranda   I dont know
No
I dont know
Well theyre dancers shes a dancer
Shes not too hot though
She does everything shes supposed to but shes not so hot anyway
You know when a girls really a terrific dancer   Wudga say she said
She wasnt listening to me even
Her mind was wandering all over the place
I said do you know when a girls really a terrific dancer  Uh-uh
Well where I have my hand on your back
If I think there isnt anything underneath my hand no can no legs no feet no anything then the girls really a terrific dancer
She wasnt listening though
So I ignored her for a while
We just danced
God could that dopey girl dance
Buddy Singer and his stinking band was playing Just One of Those Things and even they couldnt ruin it entirely
Its a swell song
I didnt try any trick stuff while we danced I hate a guy that does a lot of show-off tricky stuff on the dance floor but I was moving her around plenty and she stayed with me
The funny thing is I thought she was enjoying it too till all of a sudden she came out with this very dumb remark
I and my girl friends saw Peter Lorre last night she said
The movie actor
In person
He was buyin a newspaper
Hes cute
Youre lucky I told her
Youre really lucky
You know that She was really a moron
But what a dancer
I could hardly stop myself from sort of giving her a kiss on the top of her dopey head you know  right where the part is and all
She got sore when I did it
Hey Whats the idea   Nothing
No idea
You really can dance I said
I have a kid sister thats only in the goddam fourth grade
Youre about as good as she is and she can dance better than anybody living or dead
Watch your language if you dont mind
What a lady boy
A queen for Chrissake
Where you girls from I asked her
She didnt answer me though
She was busy looking around for old Peter Lorre to show up I guess
Where you girls from I asked her again
What she said
Where you girls from Dont answer if you dont feel like it
I dont want you to strain yourself
Seattle Washington she said
She was doing me a big favor to tell me
Youre a very good conversationalist I told her
You know that  What   I let it drop
It was over her head anyway
Do you feel like jitterbugging a little bit if they play a fast one Not corny jitterbug not jump or anything just nice and easy
Everybodyll all sit down when they play a fast one except the old guys and the fat guys and well have plenty of room
Okay   Its immaterial to me she said
Hey how old are you anyhow   That annoyed me for some reason
Oh Christ
Dont spoil it I said
Im twelve for Chrissake
Im big for my age
Listen
I toleja about that
I dont like that type language she said
If youre gonna use that type language I can go sit down with my girl friends you know
I apologized like a madman because the band was starting a fast one
She started jitterbugging with me  but just very nice and easy not corny
She was really good
All you had to do was touch her
And when she turned around her pretty little butt twitched so nice and all
She knocked me out
I mean it
I was half in love with her by the time we sat down
Thats the thing about girls
Every time they do something pretty even if theyre not much to look at or even if theyre sort of stupid you fall half in love with them and then you never know where the hell you are
Girls
Jesus Christ
They can drive you crazy
They really can
They didnt invite me to sit down at their table  mostly because they were too ignorant but I sat down anyway
The blonde Id been dancing withs name was Bernice something Crabs or Krebs
The two ugly ones names were Marty and Laverne
I told them my name was Jim Steele just for the hell of it
Then I tried to get them in a little intelligent conversation but it was practically impossible
You had to twist their arms
You could hardly tell which was the stupidest of the three of them
And the whole three of them kept looking all around the goddam room like as if they expected a flock of goddam movie stars to come in any minute
They probably thought movie stars always hung out in the Lavender Room when they came to New York instead of the Stork Club or El Morocco and all
Anyway it took me about a half hour to find out where they all worked and all in Seattle
They all worked in the same insurance office
I asked them if they liked it but do you think you could get an intelligent answer out of those three dopes I thought the two ugly ones Marty and Laverne were sisters but they got very insulted when I asked them
You could tell neither one of them wanted to look like the other one and you couldnt blame them but it was very amusing anyway
I danced with them all the whole three of them one at a time
The one ugly one Laverne wasnt too bad a dancer but the other one old Marty was murder
Old Marty was like dragging the Statue of Liberty around the floor
The only way I could even half enjoy myself dragging her around was if I amused myself a little
So I told her I just saw Gary Cooper the movie star on the other side of the floor
Where she asked me excited as hell
Where   Aw you just missed him
He just went out
Why didnt you look when I told you   She practically stopped dancing and started looking over everybodys heads to see if she could see him
Oh shoot she said
Id just about broken her heart  I really had
I was sorry as hell Id kidded her
Some people you shouldnt kid even if they deserve it
Heres what was very funny though
When we got back to the table old Marty told the other two that Gary Cooper had just gone out
Boy old Laverne and Bernice nearly committed suicide when they heard that
They got all excited and asked Marty if shed seen him and all
Old Mart said shed only caught a glimpse of him
That killed me
The bar was closing up for the night so I bought them all two drinks apiece quick before it closed and I ordered two more Cokes for myself
The goddam table was lousy with glasses
The one ugly one Laverne kept kidding me because I was only drinking Cokes
She had a sterling sense of humor
She and old Marty were drinking Tom Collinses in the middle of December for Gods sake
They didnt know any better
The
blonde one old Bernice was drinking bourbon and water
She was really putting it away too
The whole three of them kept looking for movie stars the whole time
They hardly talked even to each other
Old Marty talked more than the other two
She kept saying these very corny boring things like calling the can the little girls room and she thought Buddy Singers poor old beat-up clarinet player was really terrific when he stood up and took a couple of ice-cold hot licks
She called his clarinet a licorice stick
Was she corny
The other ugly one Laverne thought she was a very witty type
She kept asking me to call up my father and ask him what he was doing tonight
She kept asking me if my father had a date or not
Four times she asked me that she was certainly witty
Old Bernice the blonde one didnt say hardly anything at all
Every time Id ask her something she said What That can get on your nerves after a while
All of a sudden when they finished their drink all three of them stood up on me and said they had to get to bed
They said they were going to get up early to see the first show at Radio City Music Hall
I tried to get them to stick around for a while but they wouldnt
So we said good-by and all
I told them Id look them up in Seattle sometime if I ever got there but I doubt if I ever will
Look them up I mean
With cigarettes and all the check came to about thirteen bucks
I think they shouldve at least offered to pay for the drinks they had before I joined them I wouldntve let them naturally but they shouldve at least offered
I didnt care much though
They were so ignorant and they had those sad fancy hats on and all
And that business about getting up early to see the first show at Radio City Music Hall depressed me
If somebody some girl in an awful-looking hat for instance comes all the way to New York from Seattle Washington for Gods sake and ends up getting up early in the morning to see the goddam first show at Radio City Music Hall it makes me so depressed I cant stand it
Idve bought the whole three of them a hundred drinks if only they hadnt told me that
I left the Lavender Room pretty soon after they did
They were closing it up anyway and the band had quit a long time ago
In the first place it was one of those places that are very terrible to be in unless you have somebody good to dance with or unless the waiter lets you buy real drinks instead of just Cokes
There isnt any night club in the world you can sit in for a long time unless you can at least buy some liquor and get drunk
Or unless youre with some girl that really knocks you out
All of a sudden on my way out to the lobby I got old Jane Gallagher on the brain again
I got her on and I couldnt get her off
I sat down in this vomity-looking chair in the lobby and thought about her and Stradlater sitting in that goddam Ed Bankys car and though I was pretty damn sure old Stradlater hadnt given her the time I know old Jane like a book I still couldnt get her off my brain
I knew her like a book
I really did
I mean besides checkers she was quite fond of all athletic sports and after I got to know her the whole summer long we played tennis together almost every morning and golf almost every afternoon
I really got to know her quite intimately
I dont mean it was anything physical or anything it wasnt but we saw each other all the time
You dont always have to get too sexy to get to know a girl
The way I met her this Doberman pinscher she had used to come over and relieve himself on our lawn and my mother got very irritated about it
She called up Janes mother and made a big stink about it
My mother can make a very big stink about that kind of stuff
Then what happened a couple of days later I saw Jane laying on her stomach next to the swimming pool at the club and I said hello to her
I knew she lived in the house next to ours but Id never conversed with her before or anything
She gave me the big freeze when I said hello that day though
I had a helluva time convincing her that I didnt give a good goddam where her dog relieved himself
He could do it in the living room for all I cared
Anyway after that Jane and I got to be friends and all
I played golf with her that same afternoon
She lost eight balls I remember
Eight
I had a terrible time getting her to at least open her eyes when she took a swing at the ball
I improved her game immensely though
Im a very good golfer
If I told you what I go around in you probably wouldnt believe me
I almost was once in a movie short but I changed my mind at the last minute
I figured that anybody that hates the movies as much as I do Id be a phony if I let them stick me in a movie short
She was a funny girl old Jane
I wouldnt exactly describe her as strictly beautiful
She knocked me out though
She was sort of muckle-mouthed
I mean when she was talking and she got excited about something her mouth sort of went in about fifty directions her lips and all
That killed me
And she never really closed it all the way her mouth
It was always just a little bit open especially when she got in her golf stance or when she was reading a book
She was always reading and she read very good books
She read a lot of poetry and all
She was the only one outside my family that I ever showed Allies baseball mitt to with all the poems written on it
Shed never met Allie or anything because that was her first summer in Maine before that she went to Cape Cod but I told her quite a lot about him
She was interested in that kind of stuff
My mother didnt like her too much
I mean my mother always thought Jane and her mother were sort of snubbing her or something when they didnt say hello
My mother saw them in the village a lot because Jane used to drive to market with her mother in this LaSalle convertible they had
My mother didnt think Jane was pretty even
I did though
I just liked the way she looked thats all
I remember this one afternoon
It was the only time old Jane and I ever got close to necking even
It was a Saturday and it was raining like a bastard out and I was over at her house on the porch they had this big screened-in porch
We were playing checkers
I used to kid her once in a while because she wouldnt take her kings out of the back row
But I didnt kid her much though
You never wanted to kid Jane too much
I think I really like it best when you can kid the pants off a girl when the opportunity arises but its a funny thing
The girls I like best are the ones I never feel much like kidding
Sometimes I think theyd like it if you kidded them in fact I know they would but its hard to get started once youve known them a pretty long time and never kidded them
Anyway I was telling you about that afternoon Jane and I came close to necking
It was raining like hell and we were out on her porch and all of a sudden this booze hound her mother was married to came out on the porch and asked Jane if there were any cigarettes in the house
I didnt know him too well or anything but he looked like the kind of guy that wouldnt talk to you much unless he wanted something off you
He had a lousy personality
Anyway old Jane wouldnt answer him when he asked her if she knew where there was any cigarettes
So the guy asked her again but she still wouldnt answer him
She didnt
even look up from the game
Finally the guy went inside the house
When he did I asked Jane what the hell was going on
She wouldnt even answer me then
She made out like she was concentrating on her next move in the game and all
Then all of a sudden this tear plopped down on the checkerboard
On one of the red squares boy I can still see it
She just rubbed it into the board with her finger
I dont know why but it bothered hell out of me
So what I did was I went over and made her move over on the glider so that I could sit down next to her I practically sat down in her lap as a matter of fact
Then she really started to cry and the next thing I knew I was kissing her all over anywhere her eyes her nose her forehead her eyebrows and all her ears her whole face except her mouth and all
She sort of wouldnt let me get to her mouth
Anyway it was the closest we ever got to necking
After a while she got up and went in and put on this red and white sweater she had that knocked me out and we went to a goddam movie
I asked her on the way if Mr Cudahy that was the booze hounds name had ever tried to get wise with her
She was pretty young but she had this terrific figure and I wouldntve put it past that Cudahy bastard
She said no though
I never did find out what the hell was the matter
Some girls you practically never find out whats the matter
I dont want you to get the idea she was a goddam icicle or something just because we never necked or horsed around much
She wasnt
I held hands with her all the time for instance
That doesnt sound like much I realize but she was terrific to hold hands with
Most girls if you hold hands with them their goddam hand dies on you or else they think they have to keep moving their hand all the time as if they were afraid theyd bore you or something
Jane was different
Wed get into a goddam movie or something and right away wed start holding hands and we wouldnt quit till the movie was over
And without changing the position or making a big deal out of it
You never even worried with Jane whether your hand was sweaty or not
All you knew was you were happy
You really were
One other thing I just thought of
One time in this movie Jane did something that just about knocked me out
The newsreel was on or something and all of a sudden I felt this hand on the back of my neck and it was Janes
It was a funny thing to do
I mean she was quite young and all and most girls if you see them putting their hand on the back of somebodys neck theyre around twenty-five or thirty and usually theyre doing it to their husband or their little kid I do it to my kid sister Phoebe once in a while for instance
But if a girls quite young and all and she does it its so pretty it just about kills you
Anyway thats what I was thinking about while I sat in that vomity-looking chair in the lobby
Old Jane
Every time I got to the part about her out with Stradlater in that damn Ed Bankys car it almost drove me crazy
I knew she wouldnt let him get to first base with her but it drove me crazy anyway
I dont even like to talk about it if you want to know the truth
There was hardly anybody in the lobby any more
Even all the whory-looking blondes werent around any more and all of a sudden I felt like getting the hell out of the place
It was too depressing
And I wasnt tired or anything
So I went up to my room and put on my coat
I also took a look out the window to see if all the perverts were still in action but the lights and all were out now
I went down in the elevator again and got a cab and told the driver to take me down to Ernies
Ernies is this night club in Greenwich Village that my brother DB used to go to quite frequently before he went out to
Hollywood and prostituted himself
He used to take me with him once in a while
Ernies a big fat colored guy that plays the piano
Hes a terrific snob and he wont hardly even talk to you unless youre a big shot or a celebrity or something but he can really play the piano
Hes so good hes almost corny in fact
I dont exactly know what I mean by that but I mean it
I certainly like to hear him play but sometimes you feel like turning his goddam piano over
I think its because sometimes when he plays he sounds like the kind of guy that wont talk to you unless youre a big shot
The cab I had was a real old one that smelled like someoned just tossed his cookies in it
I always get those vomity kind of cabs if I go anywhere late at night
What made it worse it was so quiet and lonesome out even though it was Saturday night
I didnt see hardly anybody on the street
Now and then you just saw a man and a girl crossing a street with their arms around each others waists and all or a bunch of hoodlumy-looking guys and their dates all of them laughing like hyenas at something you could bet wasnt funny
New Yorks terrible when somebody laughs on the street very late at night
You can hear it for miles
It makes you feel so lonesome and depressed
I kept wishing I could go home and shoot the bull for a while with old Phoebe
But finally after I was riding a while the cab driver and I sort of struck up a conversation
His name was Horwitz
He was a much better guy than the other driver Id had
Anyway I thought maybe he might know about the ducks
Hey Horwitz I said
You ever pass by the lagoon in Central Park Down by Central Park South  The what   The lagoon
That little lake like there
Where the ducks are
You know
Yeah what about it   Well you know the ducks that swim around in it In the springtime and all Do you happen to know where they go in the wintertime by any chance   Where who goes   The ducks
Do you know by any chance I mean does somebody come around in a truck or something and take them away or do they fly away by themselves go south or something   Old Horwitz turned all the way around and looked at me
He was a very impatient-type guy
He wasnt a bad guy though
How the hell should I know he said
How the hell should I know a stupid thing like that   Well dont get sore about it I said
He was sore about it or something
Whos sore Nobodys sore
I stopped having a conversation with him if he was going to get so damn touchy about it
But he started it up again himself
He turned all the way around again and said The fish dont go no place
They stay right where they are the fish
Right in the goddam lake
The fish thats different
The fish is different
Im talking about the ducks I said
Whats different about it Nothins different about it Horwitz said
Everything he said he sounded sore about something
Its tougher for the fish the winter and all than it is for the ducks for Chrissake
Use your head for Chrissake
I didnt say anything for about a minute
Then I said All right
What do they do the fish and all when that whole little lakes a solid block of ice people skating on it and all   Old Horwitz turned around again
What the hellaya mean what do they do he yelled at me
They stay right where they are for Chrissake
They cant just ignore the ice
They cant just ignore it
Whos ignoring it Nobodys ignoring it Horwitz said
He got so damn excited and all I was afraid he was going to drive the cab right into a lamppost or something
They live right in the goddam ice
Its their nature for Chrissake
They get frozen right in one position for the whole winter
Yeah What do they eat then I mean if theyre frozen solid they cant swim around looking for food and all
Their bodies for Chrissake whatsa matter with ya Their bodies take in nutrition and all right through the goddam seaweed and crap thats in the ice
They got their pores open the whole time
Thats their nature for Chrissake
See what I mean He turned way the hell around again to look at me
Oh I said
I let it drop
I was afraid he was going to crack the damn taxi up or something
Besides he was such a touchy guy it wasnt any pleasure discussing anything with him
Would you care to stop off and have a drink with me somewhere I said
He didnt answer me though
I guess he was still thinking
I asked him again though
He was a pretty good guy
Quite amusing and all
I aint got no time for no liquor bud he said
How the hell old are you anyways Why aintcha home in bed   Im not tired
When I got out in front of Ernies and paid the fare old Horwitz brought up the fish again
He certainly had it on his mind
Listen he said
If you was a fish Mother Natured take care of you wouldnt she Right You dont think them fish just die when it gets to be winter do ya  No but    Youre goddam right they dont Horwitz said and drove off like a bat out of hell
He was about the touchiest guy I ever met
Everything you said made him sore
Even though it was so late old Ernies was jampacked
Mostly with prep school jerks and college jerks
Almost every damn school in the world gets out earlier for Christmas vacation than the schools I go to
You could hardly check your coat it was so crowded
It was pretty quiet though because Ernie was playing the piano
It was supposed to be something holy for Gods sake when he sat down at the piano
Nobodys that good
About three couples besides me were waiting for tables and they were all shoving and standing on tiptoes to get a look at old Ernie while he played
He had a big damn mirror in front of the piano with this big spotlight on him so that everybody could watch his face while he played
You couldnt see his fingers while he played just his big old face
Big deal
Im not too sure what the name of the song was that he was playing when I came in but whatever it was he was really stinking it up
He was putting all these dumb show-offy ripples in the high notes and a lot of other very tricky stuff that gives
me a pain in the ass
You shouldve heard the crowd though when he was finished
You wouldve puked
They went mad
They were exactly the same morons that laugh like hyenas in the movies at stuff that isnt funny
I swear to God if I were a piano player or an actor or something and all those dopes thought I was terrific Id hate it
I wouldnt even want them to clap for me
People always clap for the wrong things
If I were a piano player Id play it in the goddam closet
Anyway when he was finished and everybody was clapping their heads off old Ernie turned around on his stool and gave this very phony humble bow
Like as if he was a helluva humble guy besides being a terrific piano player
It was very phony I mean him being such a big snob and all
In a funny way though I felt sort of sorry for him when he was finished
I dont even think he knows any more when hes playing right or not
It isnt all his fault
I partly blame all those dopes that clap their heads off theyd foul up anybody if you gave them a chance
Anyway it made me feel depressed and lousy again and I damn near got my coat back and went back to the hotel but it was too early and I didnt feel much like being all alone
They finally got me this stinking table right up against a wall and behind a goddam post where you couldnt see anything
It was one of those tiny little tables that if the people at the next table dont get up to let you by and they never do the bastards you practically have to climb into your chair
I ordered a Scotch and soda which is my favorite drink next to frozen Daiquiris
If you were only around six years old you could get liquor at Ernies the place was so dark and all and besides nobody cared how old you were
You could even be a dope fiend and nobodyd care
I was surrounded by jerks
Im not kidding
At this other tiny table right to my left practically on top of me there was this funny-looking guy and this funny-looking girl
They were around my age or maybe just a little older
It was funny
You could see they were being careful as hell not to drink up the minimum too fast
I listened to their conversation for a while because I didnt have anything else to do
He was telling her about some pro football game hed seen that afternoon
He gave her every single goddam play in the whole game Im not kidding
He was the most boring guy I ever listened to
And you could tell his date wasnt even interested in the goddam game but she was even funnier-looking than he was so I guess she had to listen
Real ugly girls have it tough
I feel so sorry for them sometimes
Sometimes I cant even look at them especially if theyre with some dopey guy thats telling them all about a goddam football game
On my right the conversation was even worse though
On my right there was this very Joe Yale-looking guy in a gray flannel suit and one of those flitty-looking Tattersall vests
All those Ivy League bastards look alike
My father wants me to go to Yale or maybe Princeton but I swear I wouldnt go to one of those Ivy League colleges if I was dying for Gods sake
Anyway this Joe Yale-looking guy had a terrific-looking girl with him
Boy she was good-looking
But you shouldve heard the conversation they were having
In the first place they were both slightly crocked
What he was doing he was giving her a feel under the table and at the same time telling her all about some guy in his dorm that had eaten a whole bottle of aspirin and nearly committed suicide
His date kept saying to him How horrible 
Dont darling
Please dont
Not here
Imagine giving somebody a feel and telling them about a guy committing suicide at the same time They killed me
I certainly began to feel like a prize horses ass though sitting there all by myself
There wasnt anything to do except smoke and drink
What I did do though I told the waiter to ask old Ernie if hed care to join me for a drink
I told him to tell him I was
DBs brother
I dont think he ever even gave him my message though
Those bastards never give your message to anybody
All of a sudden this girl came up to me and said Holden Caulfield Her name was Lillian Simmons
My brother DB used to go around with her for a while
She had very big knockers
Hi I said
I tried to get up naturally but it was some job getting up in a place like that
She had some Navy officer with her that looked like he had a poker up his ass
How marvelous to see you old Lillian Simmons said
Strictly a phony
Hows your big brother Thats all she really wanted to know
Hes fine
Hes in Hollywood
In Hollywood How marvelous Whats he doing   I dont know
Writing I said
I didnt feel like discussing it
You could tell she thought it was a big deal his being in Hollywood
Almost everybody does
Mostly people whove never read any of his stories
It drives me crazy though
How exciting old Lillian said
Then she introduced me to the Navy guy
His name was Commander Blop or something
He was one of those guys that think theyre being a pansy if they dont break around forty of your fingers when they shake hands with you
God I hate that stuff
Are you all alone baby old Lillian asked me
She was blocking up the whole goddam traffic in the aisle
You could tell she liked to block up a lot of traffic
This waiter was waiting for her to move out of the way but she didnt even notice him
It was funny
You could tell the waiter didnt like her much you could tell even the Navy guy didnt like her much even though he was dating her
And I didnt like her much
Nobody did
You had to feel sort of sorry for her in a way
Dont you have a date baby she asked me
I was standing up now and she didnt even tell me to sit down
She was the type that keeps you standing up for hours
Isnt he handsome she said to the Navy guy
Holden youre getting handsomer by the minute
The Navy guy told her to come on
He told her they were blocking up the whole aisle
Holden come join us old Lillian said
Bring your drink
I was just leaving I told her
I have to meet somebody
You could tell she was just trying to get in good with me
So that Id tell old DB about it
Well you little so-and-so
All right for you
Tell your big brother I hate him when you see him
Then she left
The Navy guy and I told each other we were glad tove met each other
Which always kills me
Im always saying Glad tove met you to somebody Im not at all glad I met
If you want to stay alive you have to say that stuff though
After Id told her I had to meet somebody I didnt have any goddam choice except to leave
I couldnt even stick around to hear old Ernie play something halfway decent
But I certainly wasnt going to sit down at a table with old Lillian Simmons and that Navy guy and be bored to death
So I left
It made me mad though when I was getting my coat
People are always ruining things for you
I walked all the way back to the hotel
Forty-one gorgeous blocks
I didnt do it because I felt like walking or anything
It was more because I didnt feel like getting in
and out of another taxicab
Sometimes you get tired of riding in taxicabs the same way you get tired riding in elevators
All of a sudden you have to walk no matter how far or how high up
When I was a kid I used to walk all the way up to our apartment very frequently
Twelve stories
You wouldnt even have known it had snowed at all
There was hardly any snow on the sidewalks
But it was freezing cold and I took my red hunting hat out of my pocket and put it on I didnt give a damn how I looked
I even put the earlaps down
I wished I knew whod swiped my gloves at Pencey because my hands were freezing
Not that Id have done much about it even if I had known
Im one of these very yellow guys
I try not to show it but I am
For instance if Id found out at Pencey whod stolen my gloves I probably wouldve gone down to the crooks room and said Okay
How bout handing over those gloves Then the crook that had stolen them probably wouldve said his voice very innocent and all What gloves Then what I probably wouldve done Id have gone in his closet and found the gloves somewhere
Hidden in his goddam galoshes or something for instance
Id have taken them out and showed them to the guy and said I suppose these are your goddam gloves Then the crook probably wouldve given me this very phony innocent look and said I never saw those gloves before in my life
If theyre yours take em
I dont want the goddam things
Then I probably wouldve just stood there for about five minutes
Id have the damn gloves right in my hand and all but Id feel I ought to sock the guy in the jaw or something break his goddam jaw
Only I wouldnt have the guts to do it
Id just stand there trying to look tough
What I might do I might say something very cutting and snotty to rile him up instead of socking him in the jaw
Anyway if I did say something very cutting and snotty hed probably get up and come over to me and say Listen Caulfield
Are you calling me a crook Then instead of saying Youre goddam right I am you dirty crooked bastard all I probably wouldve said would be All I know is my goddam gloves were in your goddam galoshes
Right away then the guy would know for sure that I wasnt going to take a sock at him and he probably wouldve said Listen
Lets get this straight
Are you calling me a thief Then I probably wouldve said Nobodys calling anybody a thief
All I know is my gloves were in your goddam galoshes
It could go on like that for hours
Finally though Id leave his room without even taking a sock at him
Id probably go down to the can and sneak a cigarette and watch myself getting tough in the mirror
Anyway thats what I thought about the whole way back to the hotel
Its no fun to he yellow
Maybe Im not all yellow
I dont know
I think maybe Im just partly yellow and partly the type that doesnt give much of a damn if they lose their gloves
One of my troubles is I never care too much when I lose something it used to drive my mother crazy when I was a kid
Some guys spend days looking for something they lost
I never seem to have anything that if I lost it Id care too much
Maybe thats why Im partly yellow
Its no excuse though
It really isnt
What you should be is not yellow at all
If youre supposed to sock somebody in the jaw and you sort of feel like doing it you should do it
Im just no good at it though
Id rather push a guy out the window or chop his head off with an ax than sock him in the jaw
I hate fist fights
I dont mind getting hit so much although Im not crazy about it naturally but what scares me most in a fist fight is the guys face
I cant stand looking at the other guys face is my trouble
It wouldnt be so bad if you could both be blindfolded or something
Its a funny kind of yellowness when you come to think of it but its yellowness all right
Im not kidding myself
The more I thought about my gloves and my yellowness the more depressed I got and I decided while I was walking and all to stop off and have a drink somewhere
Id only had three drinks at Ernies and I didnt even finish the last one
One thing I have its a terrific capacity
I can drink all night and not even show it if Im in the mood
Once at the Whooton School this other boy Raymond Goldfarb and I bought a pint of Scotch and drank it in the chapel one Saturday night where nobodyd see us
He got stinking but I hardly didnt even show it
I just got very cool and nonchalant
I puked before I went to bed but I didnt really have to I forced myself
Anyway before I got to the hotel I started to go in this dumpy-looking bar but two guys came out drunk as hell and wanted to know where the subway was
One of them was this very Cuban-looking guy and he kept breathing his stinking breath in my face while I gave him directions
I ended up not even going in the damn bar
I just went back to the hotel
The whole lobby was empty
It smelled like fifty million dead cigars
It really did
I wasnt sleepy or anything but I was feeling sort of lousy
Depressed and all
I almost wished I was dead
Then all of a sudden I got in this big mess
The first thing when I got in the elevator the elevator guy said to me Innarested in having a good time fella Or is it too late for you   How do you mean I said
I didnt know what he was driving at or anything
Innarested in a little tail tnight   Me I said
Which was a very dumb answer but its quite embarrassing when somebody comes right up and asks you a question like that
How old are you chief the elevator guy said
Why I said
Twenty-two
Uh huh
Well how bout it Yinnarested Five bucks a throw
Fifteen bucks the whole night
He looked at his wrist watch
Till noon
Five bucks a throw fifteen bucks till noon
Okay I said
It was against my principles and all but I was feeling so depressed I didnt even think
Thats the whole trouble
When youre feeling very depressed you cant even think
Okay what A throw or till noon I gotta know
Just a throw
Okay what room ya in   I looked at the red thing with my number on it on my key
Twelve twenty-two I said
I was already sort of sorry Id let the thing start rolling but it was too late now
Okay
Ill send a girl up in about fifteen minutes
He opened the doors and I got out
Hey is she good-looking I asked him
I dont want any old bag
No old bag
Dont worry about it chief
Who do I pay   Her he said
Lets go chief
He shut the doors practically right in my face
I went to my room and put some water on my hair but you cant really comb a crew cut or anything
Then I tested to see if my breath stank from so many cigarettes and the Scotch and sodas I drank at Ernies
All you do is hold your hand under your mouth and blow your breath up toward the old nostrils
It didnt seem to stink much but I
brushed my teeth anyway
Then I put on another clean shirt
I knew I didnt have to get all dolled up for a prostitute or anything but it sort of gave me something to do
I was a little nervous
I was starting to feel pretty sexy and all but I was a little nervous anyway
If you want to know the truth Im a virgin
I really am
Ive had quite a few opportunities to lose my virginity and all but Ive never got around to it yet
Something always happens
For instance if youre at a girls house her parents always come home at the wrong time or youre afraid they will
Or if youre in the back seat of somebodys car theres always somebodys date in the front seat some girl I mean that always wants to know whats going on all over the whole goddam car
I mean some girl in front keeps turning around to see what the hells going on
Anyway something always happens
I came quite close to doing it a couple of times though
One time in particular I remember
Something went wrong though  I dont even remember what any more
The thing is most of the time when youre coming pretty close to doing it with a girl a girl that isnt a prostitute or anything I mean she keeps telling you to stop
The trouble with me is I stop
Most guys dont
I cant help it
You never know whether they really want you to stop or whether theyre just scared as hell or whether theyre just telling you to stop so that if you do go through with it the blamell be on you not them
Anyway I keep stopping
The trouble is I get to feeling sorry for them
I mean most girls are so dumb and all
After you neck them for a while you can really watch them losing their brains
You take a girl when she really gets passionate she just hasnt any brains
I dont know
They tell me to stop so I stop
I always wish I hadnt after I take them home but I keep doing it anyway
Anyway while I was putting on another clean shirt I sort of figured this was my big chance in a way
I figured if she was a prostitute and all I could get in some practice on her in case I ever get married or anything
I worry about that stuff sometimes
I read this book once at the Whooton School that had this very sophisticated suave sexy guy in it
Monsieur Blanchard was his name I can still remember
It was a lousy book but this Blanchard guy was pretty good
He had this big château and all on the Riviera in Europe and all he did in his spare time was beat women off with a club
He was a real rake and all but he knocked women out
He said in this one part that a womans body is like a violin and all and that it takes a terrific musician to play it right
It was a very corny book I realize that but I couldnt get that violin stuff out of my mind anyway
In a way thats why I sort of wanted to get some practice in in case I ever get married
Caulfield and his Magic Violin boy
Its corny I realize but it isnt too corny
I wouldnt mind being pretty good at that stuff
Half the time if you really want to know the truth when Im horsing around with a girl I have a helluva lot of trouble just finding what Im looking for for Gods sake if you know what I mean
Take this girl that I just missed having sexual intercourse with that I told you about
It took me about an hour to just get her goddam brassiere off
By the time I did get it off she was about ready to spit in my eye
Anyway I kept walking around the room waiting for this prostitute to show up
I kept hoping shed be good-looking
I didnt care too much though
I sort of just wanted to get it over with
Finally somebody knocked on the door and when I went to open it I had my suitcase right in the way and I fell over it and damn near broke my knee
I always pick a gorgeous time to fall over a suitcase or something
When I opened the door this prostitute was standing there
She had a polo coat on and no hat
She was sort of a blonde but you could tell she dyed her hair
She wasnt any old bag though
How do you do I said
Suave as hell boy
You the guy Maurice said she asked me
She didnt seem too goddam friendly
Is he the elevator boy   Yeah she said
Yes I am
Come in wont you I said
I was getting more and more nonchalant as it went along
I really was
She came in and took her coat off right away and sort of chucked it on the bed
She had on a green dress underneath
Then she sort of sat down sideways on the chair that went with the desk in the room and started jiggling her foot up and down
She crossed her legs and started jiggling this one foot up and down
She was very nervous for a prostitute
She really was
I think it was because she was young as hell
She was around my age
I sat down in the big chair next to her and offered her a cigarette
I dont smoke she said
She had a tiny little wheeny-whiny voice
You could hardly hear her
She never said thank you either when you offered her something
She just didnt know any better
Allow me to introduce myself
My name is Jim Steele I said
Ya got a watch on ya she said
She didnt care what the hell my name was naturally
Hey how old are you anyways  Me Twenty-two
Like fun you are
It was a funny thing to say
It sounded like a real kid
Youd think a prostitute and all would say Like hell you are or Cut the crap instead of Like fun you are
How old are you I asked her
Old enough to know better she said
She was really witty
Ya got a watch on ya she asked me again and then she stood up and pulled her dress over her head
I certainly felt peculiar when she did that
I mean she did it so sudden and all
I know youre supposed to feel pretty sexy when somebody gets up and pulls their dress over their head but I didnt
Sexy was about the last thing I was feeling
I felt much more depressed than sexy
Ya got a watch on ya hey   No
No I dont I said
Boy was I feeling peculiar
Whats your name I asked her
All she had on was this pink slip
It was really quite embarrassing
It really was
Sunny she said
Lets go hey
Dont you feel like talking for a while I asked her
It was a childish thing to say but I was feeling so damn peculiar
Are you in a very big hurry   She looked at me like I was a madman
What the heck ya wanna talk about she said
I dont know
Nothing special
I just thought perhaps you might care to chat for a while
She sat down in the chair next to the desk again
She didnt like it though you could tell
She started jiggling her foot again boy she was a nervous girl
Would you care for a cigarette now I said
I forgot she didnt smoke
I dont smoke
Listen if youre gonna talk do it
I got things to do
I couldnt think of anything to talk about though
I thought of asking her how she got to be a prostitute and all but I was scared to ask her
She probably wouldntve told me anyway
You dont come from New York do you I said finally
Thats all I could think of
Hollywood she said
Then she got up and went over to where shed put her dress down on the bed
Ya got a hanger I dont want to get my dress all wrinkly
Its brand-clean
Sure I said right away
I was only too glad to get up and do something
I took her dress over to the closet and hung it up for her
It was funny
It made me feel sort of sad when I hung it up
I thought of her going in a store and buying it and nobody in the store knowing she was a prostitute and all
The salesman probably just thought she was a regular girl when she bought it
It made me feel sad as hell I dont know why exactly
I sat down again and tried to keep the old conversation going
She was a lousy conversationalist
Do you work every night I asked her it sounded sort of awful after Id said it
Yeah
She was walking all around the room
She picked up the menu off the desk and read it
What do you do during the day   She sort of shrugged her shoulders
She was pretty skinny
Sleep
Go to the show
She put down the menu and looked at me
Lets go hey
I havent got all    Look I said
I dont feel very much like myself tonight
Ive had a rough night
Honest to God
Ill pay you and all but do you mind very much if we dont do it Do you mind very much The trouble was I just didnt want to do it
I felt more depressed than sexy if you want to know the truth
She was depressing
Her green dress hanging in the closet and all
And besides I dont think I could ever do it with somebody that sits in a stupid movie all day long
I really dont think I could
She came over to me with this funny look on her face like as if she didnt believe me
Whatsa matter she said
Nothings the matter
Boy was I getting nervous
The thing is I had an operation very recently
Yeah Where   On my wuddayacallit my clavichord
Yeah Where the hells that   The clavichord I said
Well actually its in the spinal canal
I mean its quite a ways down in the spinal canal
Yeah she said
Thats tough
Then she sat down on my goddam lap
Youre cute
She made me so nervous I just kept on lying my head off
Im still recuperating I told her
You look like a guy in the movies
You know
Whosis
You know who I mean
What the hecks his name   I dont know I said
She wouldnt get off my goddam lap
Sure you know
He was in that pitcher with Mel-vine Douglas The one that was Mel-vine Douglass kid brother That falls off this boat You know who I mean
No I dont
I go to the movies as seldom as I can
Then she started getting funny
Crude and all
Do you mind cutting it out I said
Im not in the mood I just told you
I just had an operation
She didnt get up from my lap or anything but she gave me this terrifically dirty look
Listen she said
I was sleepin when that crazy Maurice woke me up
If you think Im    I said Id pay you for coming and all
I really will
I have plenty of dough
Its just that Im practically just recovering from a very serious    What the heck did you tell that crazy Maurice you wanted a girl for then If you just had a goddam operation on your goddam wuddayacallit
Huh   I thought Id be feeling a lot better than I do
I was a little premature in my calculations
No kidding
Im sorry
If youll just get up a second Ill get my wallet
I mean it
She was sore as hell but she got up off my goddam lap so that I could go over and get my wallet off the chiffonier
I took out a five-dollar bill and handed it to her
Thanks a lot I told her
Thanks a million
This is a five
It costs ten
She was getting funny you could tell
I was afraid something like that would happen I really was
Maurice said five I told her
He said fifteen till noon and only five for a throw
Ten for a throw
He said five
Im sorry I really am but thats all Im gonna shell out
She sort of shrugged her shoulders the way she did before and then she said very cold Do you mind getting me my frock Or would it be too much trouble She was a pretty spooky kid
Even with that little bitty voice she had she could sort of scare you a little bit
If shed been a big old prostitute with a lot of makeup on her face and all she wouldnt have been half as spooky
I went and got her dress for her
She put it on and all and then she picked up her polo coat off the bed
So long crumb-bum she said
So long I said
I didnt thank her or anything
Im glad I didnt
After Old Sunny was gone I sat in the chair for a while and smoked a couple of cigarettes
It was getting daylight outside
Boy I felt miserable
I felt so depressed you cant imagine
What I did I started talking sort of out loud to Allie
I do that sometimes when I get very depressed
I keep telling him to go home and get his bike and meet me in front of Bobby Fallons house
Bobby Fallon used to live quite near us in Maine this is years ago
Anyway what happened was one day Bobby and I were going over to Lake Sedebego on our bikes
We were going to take our lunches and all and our BB guns we were kids and all and we thought we could shoot something with our BB guns
Anyway Allie heard us talking about it and he wanted to go and I wouldnt let him
I told him he was a child
So once in a while now when I get very depressed I keep saying to him Okay
Go home and get your bike and meet me in front of Bobbys house
Hurry up
It
wasnt that I didnt use to take him with me when I went somewhere
I did
But that one day I didnt
He didnt get sore about it he never got sore about anything  but I keep thinking about it anyway when I get very depressed
Finally though I got undressed and got in bed
I felt like praying or something when I was in bed but I couldnt do it
I cant always pray when I feel like it
In the first place Im sort of an atheist
I like Jesus and all but I dont care too much for most of the other stuff in the Bible
Take the Disciples for instance
They annoy the hell out of me if you want to know the truth
They were all right after Jesus was dead and all but while He was alive they were about as much use to Him as a hole in the head
All they did was keep letting Him down
I like almost anybody in the Bible better than the Disciples
If you want to know the truth the guy I like best in the Bible next to Jesus was that lunatic and all that lived in the tombs and kept cutting himself with stones
I like him ten times as much as the Disciples that poor bastard
I used to get in quite a few arguments about it when I was at Whooton School with this boy that lived down the corridor Arthur Childs
Old Childs was a Quaker and all and he read the Bible all the time
He was a very nice kid and I liked him but I could never see eye to eye with him on a lot of stuff in the Bible especially the Disciples
He kept telling me if I didnt like the Disciples then I didnt like Jesus and all
He said that because Jesus picked the Disciples you were supposed to like them
I said I knew He picked them but that He picked them at random
I said He didnt have time to go around analyzing everybody
I said I wasnt blaming Jesus or anything
It wasnt His fault that He didnt have any time
I remember I asked old Childs if he thought Judas the one that betrayed Jesus and all went to Hell after he committed suicide
Childs said certainly
Thats exactly where I disagreed with him
I said Id bet a thousand bucks that Jesus never sent old Judas to Hell
I still would too if I had a thousand bucks
I think any one of the Disciples wouldve sent him to Hell and all and fast too but Ill bet anything Jesus didnt do it
Old Childs said the trouble with me was that I didnt go to church or anything
He was right about that in a way
I dont
In the first place my parents are different religions and all the children in our family are atheists
If you want to know the truth I cant even stand ministers
The ones theyve had at every school Ive gone to they all have these Holy Joe voices when they start giving their sermons
God I hate that
I dont see why the hell they cant talk in their natural voice
They sound so phony when they talk
Anyway when I was in bed I couldnt pray worth a damn
Every time I got started I kept picturing old Sunny calling me a crumb-bum
Finally I sat up in bed and smoked another cigarette
It tasted lousy
I mustve smoked around two packs since I left Pencey
All of a sudden while I was laying there smoking somebody knocked on the door
I kept hoping it wasnt my door they were knocking on but I knew damn well it was
I dont know how I knew but I knew
I knew who it was too
Im psychic
Whos there I said
I was pretty scared
Im very yellow about those things
They just knocked again though
Louder
Finally I got out of bed with just my pajamas on and opened the door
I didnt even have to turn the light on in the room because it was already daylight
Old Sunny and Maurice the pimpy elevator guy were standing there
Whats the matter Wuddaya want I said
Boy my voice was shaking like hell
Nothin much old Maurice said
Just five bucks
He did all the talking for the two of them
Old Sunny just stood there next to him with her mouth open and all
I paid her already
I gave her five bucks
Ask her I said
Boy was my voice shaking
Its ten bucks chief
I tole ya that
Ten bucks for a throw fifteen bucks till noon
I tole ya that
You did not tell me that
You said five bucks a throw
You said fifteen bucks till noon all right but I distinctly heard you    Open up chief
What for I said
God my old heart was damn near beating me out of the room
I wished I was dressed at least
Its terrible to be just in your pajamas when something like that happens
Lets go chief old Maurice said
Then he gave me a big shove with his crumby hand
I damn near fell over on my can he was a huge sonuvabitch
The next thing I knew he and old Sunny were both in the room
They acted like they owned the damn place
Old Sunny sat down on the window sill
Old Maurice sat down in the big chair and loosened his collar and all he was wearing this elevator operators uniform
Boy was I nervous
All right chief lets have it
I gotta get back to work
I told you about ten times I dont owe you a cent
I already gave her the five    Cut the crap now
Lets have it
Why should I give her another five bucks I said
My voice was cracking all over the place
Youre trying to chisel me
Old Maurice unbuttoned his whole uniform coat
All he had on underneath was a phony shirt collar but no shirt or anything
He had a big fat hairy stomach
Nobodys tryna chisel nobody he said
Lets have it chief
No
When I said that he got up from his chair and started walking towards me and all
He looked like he was very very tired or very very bored
God was I scared
I sort of had my arms folded I remember
It wouldnt have been so bad I dont think if I hadnt had just my goddam pajamas on
Lets have it chief
He came right up to where I was standing
Thats all he could say
Lets have it chief
He was a real moron
No
Chief youre gonna force me inna roughin ya up a little bit
I dont wanna do it but thats the way it looks he said
You owe us five bucks
I dont owe you five bucks I said
If you rough me up Ill yell like hell
Ill wake up everybody in the hotel
The police and all
My voice was shaking like a bastard
Go ahead
Yell your goddam head off
Fine old Maurice said
Want your parents to know you spent the night with a whore High-class kid like you He was pretty sharp in his crumby way
He really was
Leave me alone
If youd said ten itd be different
But you distinctly    Are ya gonna let us have it He had me right up against the damn door
He was almost standing on top of me his crumby old hairy stomach and all
Leave me alone
Get the hell out of my room I said
I still had my arms folded and all
God what a jerk I was
Then Sunny said something for the first time
Hey Maurice
Want me to get his wallet she said
Its right on the wutchamacallit
Yeah get it
Leave my wallet alone   I awreddy got it Sunny said
She waved five bucks at me
See All Im takin is the five you owe me
Im no crook
All of a sudden I started to cry
Id give anything if I hadnt but I did
No youre no crooks I said
Youre just stealing five    Shut up old Maurice said and gave me a shove
Leave him alone hey Sunny said
Cmon hey
We got the dough he owes us
Lets go
Cmon hey
Im comin old Maurice said
But he didnt
I mean it Maurice hey
Leave him alone
Whos hurtin anybody he said innocent as hell
Then what he did he snapped his finger very hard on my pajamas
I wont tell you where he snapped it but it hurt like hell
I told him he was a goddam dirty moron
Whats that he said
He put his hand behind his ear like a deaf guy
Whats that What am I   I was still sort of crying
I was so damn mad and nervous and all
Youre a dirty moron I said
Youre a stupid chiseling moron and in about two years youll be one of those scraggy guys that come up to you on the street and ask for a dime for coffee
Youll have snot all over your dirty filthy overcoat and youll be    Then he smacked me
I didnt even try to get out of the way or duck or anything
All I felt was this terrific punch in my stomach
I wasnt knocked out or anything though because I remember looking up from the floor and seeing them both go out the door and shut it
Then I stayed on the floor a fairly long time sort of the way I did with Stradlater
Only this time I thought I was dying
I really did
I thought I was drowning or something
The trouble was I could hardly breathe
When I did finally get up I had to walk to the bathroom all doubled up and holding onto my stomach and all
But Im crazy
I swear to God I am
About halfway to the bathroom I sort of started pretending I had a bullet in my guts
Old Maurice had plugged me
Now I was on the way to the bathroom to get a good shot of bourbon or something to steady my nerves and help me really go into action
I pictured myself coming out of the goddam bathroom dressed and all with my automatic in my pocket and staggering around a little bit
Then Id walk downstairs instead of using the elevator
Id hold onto the banister and all with this blood trickling out of the side of my mouth a little at a time
What Id do Id walk down a few floors holding onto my guts blood leaking all over the place  and then Id ring the elevator bell
As soon as old Maurice opened the doors hed see me with the automatic in my hand and hed start screaming at me in this very high-pitched yellow-belly voice to leave him alone
But Id plug him anyway
Six shots right through his fat hairy belly
Then Id throw my automatic down the elevator shaft after Id wiped off all the finger prints and all
Then Id crawl back to my room and call up Jane and have her come over and bandage up my guts
I pictured her holding a cigarette for me to smoke while I was bleeding and all
The goddam movies
They can ruin you
Im not kidding
I stayed in the bathroom for about an hour taking a bath and all
Then I got back in bed
It took me quite a while to get to sleep I wasnt even tired but finally I did
What I really felt like though was committing suicide
I felt like jumping out the window
I probably wouldve done it too if Id been sure somebodyd cover me up as soon as I landed
I didnt want a bunch of stupid rubbernecks looking at me when I was all gory
I didnt sleep too long because I think it was only around ten oclock when I woke up
I felt pretty hungry as soon as I had a cigarette
The last time Id eaten was those two hamburgers I had with Brossard and Ackley when we went in to Agerstown to the movies
That was a long time ago
It seemed like fifty years ago
The phone was right next to me and I started to call down and have them send up some breakfast but I was sort of afraid they might send it up with old Maurice
If you think I was dying to see him again youre crazy
So I just laid around in bed for a while and smoked another cigarette
I thought of giving old Jane a buzz to see if she was home yet and all but I wasnt in the mood
What I did do I gave old Sally Hayes a buzz
She went to Mary A
Woodruff and I knew she was home because Id had this letter from her a couple of weeks ago
I wasnt too crazy about her but Id known her for years
I used to think she was quite intelligent in my stupidity
The reason I did was because she knew quite a lot about the theater and plays and literature and all that stuff
If somebody knows quite a lot about those things it takes you quite a while to find out whether theyre really stupid or not
It took me years to find it out in old Sallys case
I think Id have found it out a lot sooner if we hadnt necked so damn much
My big trouble is I always sort of think whoever Im necking is a pretty intelligent person
It hasnt got a goddam thing to do with it but I keep thinking it anyway
Anyway I gave her a buzz
First the maid answered
Then her father
Then she got on
Sally I said
Yes who is this she said
She was quite a little phony
Id already told her father who it was
Holden Caulfield
How are ya   Holden Im fine How are you   Swell
Listen
How are ya anyway I mean hows school   Fine she said
I mean you know
Swell
Well listen
I was wondering if you were busy today
Its Sunday but theres always one or two matinees going on Sunday
Benefits and that stuff
Would you care to go   Id love to
Grand
Grand
If theres one word I hate its grand
Its so phony
For a second I was tempted to tell her to forget about the matinee
But we chewed the fat for a while
That is she chewed it
You couldnt get a word in edgewise
First she told me about some Harvard guy  it probably was a freshman but she didnt say naturally that was rushing hell out of her
Calling her up night and day
Night and day that killed me
Then she told me about some other guy some West Point cadet that was cutting his throat over her too
Big deal
I told her to meet me under the clock at the Biltmore at two oclock and not to be late because the show probably started at two-thirty
She was always late
Then I hung up
She gave me a pain in the ass but she was very good-looking
After I made the date with old Sally I got out of bed and got dressed and packed my bag
I took a look out the window before I left the room though to see how all the perverts were doing but they all had their shades down
They were the heighth of modesty in the morning
Then I went down in the elevator and checked out
I didnt see old Maurice around anywhere
I didnt break my neck looking for him naturally the bastard
I got a cab outside the hotel but I didnt have the faintest damn idea where I was going
I had no place to go
It was only Sunday and I couldnt go home till Wednesday or Tuesday the soonest
And I certainly didnt feel like going to another hotel and getting my brains beat out
So what I did I told the driver to take me to Grand Central Station
It was right near the Biltmore where I was meeting Sally later and I figured what Id do Id check my bags in one of those strong boxes that they give you a key to then get some breakfast
I was sort of hungry
While I was in the cab I took out my wallet and sort of counted my money
I dont remember exactly what I had left but it was no fortune or anything
Id spent a kings ransom in about two lousy weeks
I really had
Im a goddam spendthrift at heart
What I dont spend I lose
Half the time I sort of even forget to pick up my change at restaurants and night clubs and all
It drives my parents crazy
You cant blame them
My fathers quite wealthy though
I dont know how much he makes hes never discussed that stuff with me but I imagine quite a lot
Hes a corporation lawyer
Those boys really haul it in
Another reason I know hes quite well off hes always investing money in shows on Broadway
They always flop though and it drives my mother crazy when he does it
She hasnt felt too healthy since my brother Allie died
Shes very nervous
Thats another reason why I hated like hell for her to know I got the ax again
After I put my bags in one of those strong boxes at the station I went into this little sandwich bar and bad breakfast
I had quite a large breakfast for me orange juice bacon and eggs toast and coffee
Usually I just drink some orange juice
Im a very light eater
I really am
Thats why Im so damn skinny
I was supposed to be on this diet where you eat a lot of starches and crap to gain weight and all but I didnt ever do it
When Im out somewhere I generally just eat a Swiss cheese sandwich and a malted milk
It isnt much but you get quite a lot of vitamins in the malted milk
H
V
Caulfield
Holden Vitamin Caulfield
While I was eating my eggs these two nuns with suitcases and all I guessed they were moving to another convent or something and were waiting for a train came in and sat down next to me at the counter
They didnt seem to know what the hell to do with their suitcases so I gave them a hand
They were these very inexpensive-looking suitcases the ones that arent genuine leather or anything
It isnt important I know but I hate it when somebody has cheap suitcases
It sounds terrible to say it but I can even get to hate somebody just looking at them if they have cheap suitcases with them
Something happened once
For a while when I was at Elkton Hills I roomed with this boy Dick Slagle that had these very inexpensive suitcases
He used to keep them under the bed instead of on the rack so that nobodyd see them standing next to mine
It depressed holy hell out of me and I kept wanting to throw mine out or something or
even trade with him
Mine came from Mark Cross and they were genuine cowhide and all that crap and I guess they cost quite a pretty penny
But it was a funny thing
Heres what happened
What I did I finally put my suitcases under my bed instead of on the rack so that old Slagle wouldnt get a goddam inferiority complex about it
But heres what he did
The day after I put mine under my bed he took them out and put them back on the rack
The reason he did it it took me a while to find out was because he wanted people to think my bags were his
He really did
He was a very funny guy that way
He was always saying snotty things about them my suitcases for instance
He kept saying they were too new and bourgeois
That was his favorite goddam word
He read it somewhere or heard it somewhere
Everything I had was bourgeois as hell
Even my fountain pen was bourgeois
He borrowed it off me all the time but it was bourgeois anyway
We only roomed together about two months
Then we both asked to be moved
And the funny thing was I sort of missed him after we moved because he had a helluva good sense of humor and we had a lot of fun sometimes
I wouldnt be surprised if he missed me too
At first he only used to be kidding when he called my stuff bourgeois and I didnt give a damn it was sort of funny in fact
Then after a while you could tell he wasnt kidding any more
The thing is its really hard to be roommates with people if your suitcases are much better than theirs if yours are really good ones and theirs arent
You think if theyre intelligent and all the other person and have a good sense of humor that they dont give a damn whose suitcases are better but they do
They really do
Its one of the reasons why I roomed with a stupid bastard like Stradlater
At least his suitcases were as good as mine
Anyway these two nuns were sitting next to me and we sort of struck up a conversation
The one right next to me had one of those straw baskets that you see nuns and Salvation Army babes collecting dough with around Christmas time
You see them standing on corners especially on Fifth Avenue in front of the big department stores and all
Anyway the one next to me dropped hers on the floor and I reached down and picked it up for her
I asked her if she was out collecting money for charity and all
She said no
She said she couldnt get it in her suitcase when she was packing it and she was just carrying it
She had a pretty nice smile when she looked at you
She had a big nose and she had on those glasses with sort of iron rims that arent too attractive but she had a helluva kind face
I thought if you were taking up a collection I told her I could make a small contribution
You could keep the money for when you do take up a collection
Oh how very kind of you she said and the other one her friend looked over at me
The other one was reading a little black book while she drank her coffee
It looked like a Bible but it was too skinny
It was a Bible-type book though
All the two of them were eating for breakfast was toast and coffee
That depressed me
I hate it if Im eating bacon and eggs or something and somebody else is only eating toast and coffee
They let me give them ten bucks as a contribution
They kept asking me if I was sure I could afford it and all
I told them I had quite a bit of money with me but they didnt seem to believe me
They took it though finally
The both of them kept thanking me so much it was embarrassing
I swung the conversation around to general topics and asked them where they were going
They said they were schoolteachers and that theyd just come from Chicago and that they were going to start teaching at some convent on 168th Street or 186th Street or one of those streets way the hell uptown
The one next to me with the iron glasses said she taught English and her friend taught history and
American government
Then I started wondering like a bastard what the one sitting next to me that taught English thought about being a nun and all when she read certain books for English
Books not necessarily with a lot of sexy stuff in them but books with lovers and all in them
Take old Eustacia Vye in The Return of the Native by Thomas Hardy
She wasnt too sexy or anything but even so you cant help wondering what a nun maybe thinks about when she reads about old Eustacia
I didnt say anything though naturally
All I said was English was my best subject
Oh really Oh Im so glad the one with the glasses that taught English said
What have you read this year Id be very interested to know
She was really nice
Well most of the time we were on the Anglo-Saxons
Beowulf and old Grendel and Lord Randal My Son and all those things
But we had to read outside books for extra credit once in a while
I read The Return of the Native by Thomas Hardy and Romeo and Juliet and Julius    Oh Romeo and Juliet Lovely Didnt you just love it She certainly didnt sound much like a nun
Yes
I did
I liked it a lot
There were a few things I didnt like about it but it was quite moving on the whole
What didnt you like about it Can you remember To tell you the truth it was sort of embarrassing in a way to be talking about Romeo and Juliet with her
I mean that play gets pretty sexy in some parts and she was a nun and all but she asked me so I discussed it with her for a while
Well Im not too crazy about Romeo and Juliet I said
I mean I like them but I dont know
They get pretty annoying sometimes
I mean I felt much sorrier when old Mercutio got killed than when Romeo and Juliet did
The think is I never liked Romeo too much after Mercutio gets stabbed by that other man Juliets cousin whats his name  Tybalt
Thats right
Tybalt I said I always forget that guys name
It was Romeos fault
I mean I liked him the best in the play old Mercutio
I dont know
All those Montagues and Capulets theyre all right especially Juliet but Mercutio he was its hard to explain
He was very smart and entertaining and all
The thing is it drives me crazy if somebody gets killed  especially somebody very smart and entertaining and all and its somebody elses fault
Romeo and Juliet at least it was their own fault
What school do you go to she asked me
She probably wanted to get off the subject of Romeo and Juliet
I told her Pencey and shed heard of it
She said it was a very good school
I let it pass though
Then the other one the one that taught history and government said theyd better be running along
I took their check off them but they wouldnt let me pay it
The one with the glasses made me give it back to her
Youve been more than generous she said
Youre a very sweet boy
She certainly was nice
She reminded me a little bit of old Ernest Morrows mother the one I met on the train
When she smiled mostly
Weve enjoyed talking to you so much she said
I said Id enjoyed talking to them a lot too
I meant it too
Id have enjoyed it even more though I think if I hadnt been sort of afraid the whole time I was talking to them that theyd all of a sudden try to find out if I was a Catholic
Catholics are always trying to find out if youre a Catholic
It happens to me a lot I know partly because my
last name is Irish and most people of Irish descent are Catholics
As a matter of fact my father was a Catholic once
He quit though when he married my mother
But Catholics are always trying to find out if youre a Catholic even if they dont know your last name
I knew this one Catholic boy Louis Shaney when I was at the Whooton School
He was the first boy I ever met there
He and I were sitting in the first two chairs outside the goddam infirmary the day school opened waiting for our physicals and we sort of struck up this conversation about tennis
He was quite interested in tennis and so was I
He told me he went to the Nationals at Forest Hills every summer and I told him I did too and then we talked about certain hot-shot tennis players for quite a while
He knew quite a lot about tennis for a kid his age
He really did
Then after a while right in the middle of the goddam conversation he asked me Did you happen to notice where the Catholic church is in town by any chance The thing was you could tell by the way he asked me that he was trying to find out if I was a Catholic
He really was
Not that he was prejudiced or anything but he just wanted to know
He was enjoying the conversation about tennis and all but you could tell he wouldve enjoyed it more if I was a Catholic and all
That kind of stuff drives me crazy
Im not saying it ruined our conversation or anything it didnt but it sure as hell didnt do it any good
Thats why I was glad those two nuns didnt ask me if I was a Catholic
It wouldnt have spoiled the conversation if they had but it wouldve been different probably
Im not saying I blame Catholics
I dont
Id be the same way probably if I was a Catholic
Its just like those suitcases I was telling you about in a way
All Im saying is that its no good for a nice conversation
Thats all Im saying
When they got up to go the two nuns I did something very stupid and embarrassing
I was smoking a cigarette and when I stood up to say good-by to them by mistake I blew some smoke in their face
I didnt mean to but I did it
I apologized like a madman and they were very polite and nice about it but it was very embarrassing anyway
After they left I started getting sorry that Id only given them ten bucks for their collection
But the thing was Id made that date to go to a matinee with old Sally Hayes and I needed to keep some dough for the tickets and stuff
I was sorry anyway though
Goddam money
It always ends up making you blue as hell
After I had my breakfast it was only around noon and I wasnt meeting old Sally till two oclock so I started taking this long walk
I couldnt stop thinking about those two nuns
I kept thinking about that beatup old straw basket they went around collecting money with when they werent teaching school
I kept trying to picture my mother or somebody or my aunt or Sally Hayess crazy mother standing outside some department store and collecting dough for poor people in a beat-up old straw basket
It was hard to picture
Not so much my mother but those other two
My aunts pretty charitable she does a lot of Red Cross work and all but shes very well-dressed and all and when she does anything charitable shes always very well-dressed and has lipstick on and all that crap
I couldnt picture her doing anything for charity if she had to wear black clothes and no lipstick while she was doing it
And old Sally Hayess mother
Jesus Christ
The only
way she could go around with a basket collecting dough would be if everybody kissed her ass for her when they made a contribution
If they just dropped their dough in her basket then walked away without saying anything to her ignoring her and all shed quit in about an hour
Shed get bored
Shed hand in her basket and then go someplace swanky for lunch
Thats what I liked about those nuns
You could tell for one thing that they never went anywhere swanky for lunch
It made me so damn sad when I thought about it their never going anywhere swanky for lunch or anything
I knew it wasnt too important but it made me sad anyway
I started walking over toward Broadway just for the hell of it because I hadnt been over there in years
Besides I wanted to find a record store that was open on Sunday
There was this record I wanted to get for Phoebe called Little Shirley Beans
It was a very hard record to get
It was about a little kid that wouldnt go out of the house because two of her front teeth were out and she was ashamed to
I heard it at Pencey
A boy that lived on the next floor had it and I tried to buy it off him because I knew it would knock old Phoebe out but he wouldnt sell it
It was a very old terrific record that this colored girl singer Estelle Fletcher made about twenty years ago
She sings it very Dixieland and whorehouse and it doesnt sound at all mushy
If a white girl was singing it shed make it sound cute as hell but old Estelle Fletcher knew what the hell she was doing and it was one of the best records I ever heard
I figured Id buy it in some store that was open on Sunday and then Id take it up to the park with me
It was Sunday and Phoebe goes rollerskating in the park on Sundays quite frequently
I knew where she hung out mostly
It wasnt as cold as it was the day before but the sun still wasnt out and it wasnt too nice for walking
But there was one nice thing
This family that you could tell just came out of some church were walking right in front of me a father a mother and a little kid about six years old
They looked sort of poor
The father had on one of those pearl-gray hats that poor guys wear a lot when they want to look sharp
He and his wife were just walking along talking not paying any attention to their kid
The kid was swell
He was walking in the street instead of on the sidewalk but right next to the curb
He was making out like he was walking a very straight line the way kids do and the whole time he kept singing and humming
I got up closer so I could hear what he was singing
He was singing that song If a body catch a body coming through the rye
He had a pretty little voice too
He was just singing for the hell of it you could tell
The cars zoomed by brakes screeched all over the place his parents paid no attention to him and he kept on walking next to the curb and singing If a body catch a body coming through the rye
It made me feel better
It made me feel not so depressed any more
Broadway was mobbed and messy
It was Sunday and only about twelve oclock but it was mobbed anyway
Everybody was on their way to the movies the Paramount or the Astor or the Strand or the Capitol or one of those crazy places
Everybody was all dressed up because it was Sunday and that made it worse
But the worst part was that you could tell they all wanted to go to the movies
I couldnt stand looking at them
I can understand somebody going to the movies because theres nothing else to do but when somebody really wants to go and even walks fast so as to get there quicker then it depresses hell out of me
Especially if I see millions of people standing in one of those long terrible lines all the way down the block waiting with this terrific patience for seats and all
Boy I couldnt get off that goddam Broadway fast enough
I was lucky
The first
record store I went into had a copy of Little Shirley Beans
They charged me five bucks for it because it was so hard to get but I didnt care
Boy it made me so happy all of a sudden
I could hardly wait to get to the park to see if old Phoebe was around so that I could give it to her
When I came out of the record store I passed this drugstore and I went in
I figured maybe Id give old Jane a buzz and see if she was home for vacation yet
So I went in a phone booth and called her up
The only trouble was her mother answered the phone so I had to hang up
I didnt feel like getting involved in a long conversation and all with her
Im not crazy about talking to girls mothers on the phone anyway
I shouldve at least asked her if Jane was home yet though
It wouldnt have killed me
But I didnt feel like it
You really have to be in the mood for that stuff
I still had to get those damn theater tickets so I bought a paper and looked up to see what shows were playing
On account of it was Sunday there were only about three shows playing
So what I did was I went over and bought two orchestra seats for I Know My Love
It was a benefit performance or something
I didnt much want to see it but I knew old Sally the queen of the phonies would start drooling all over the place when I told her I had tickets for that because the Lunts were in it and all
She liked shows that are supposed to be very sophisticated and dry and all with the Lunts and all
I dont
I dont like any shows very much if you want to know the truth
Theyre not as bad as movies but theyre certainly nothing to rave about
In the first place I hate actors
They never act like people
They just think they do
Some of the good ones do in a very slight way but not in a way thats fun to watch
And if any actors really good you can always tell he knows hes good and that spoils it
You take Sir Laurence Olivier for example
I saw him in Hamlet
DB took Phoebe and I to see it last year
He treated us to lunch first and then he took us
Hed already seen it and the way he talked about it at lunch I was anxious as hell to see it too
But I didnt enjoy it much
I just dont see whats so marvelous about Sir Laurence Olivier thats all
He has a terrific voice and hes a helluva handsome guy and hes very nice to watch when hes walking or dueling or something but he wasnt at all the way DB said Hamlet was
He was too much like a goddam general instead of a sad screwed-up type guy
The best part in the whole picture was when old Ophelias brother the one that gets in the duel with Hamlet at the very end was going away and his father was giving him a lot of advice
While the father kept giving him a lot of advice old Ophelia was sort of horsing around with her brother taking his dagger out of the holster and teasing him and all while he was trying to look interested in the bull his father was shooting
That was nice
I got a big bang out of that
But you dont see that kind of stuff much
The only thing old Phoebe liked was when Hamlet patted this dog on the head
She thought that was funny and nice and it was
What Ill have to do is Ill have to read that play
The trouble with me is I always have to read that stuff by myself
If an actor acts it out I hardly listen
I keep worrying about whether hes going to do something phony every minute
After I got the tickets to the Lunts show I took a cab up to the park
I shouldve taken a subway or something because I was getting slightly low on dough but I wanted to get off that damn Broadway as fast as I could
It was lousy in the park
It wasnt too cold but the sun still wasnt out and there didnt look like there was anything in the park except dog crap and globs of spit and cigar butts from old men and the benches all looked like theyd be wet if you sat down on
them
It made you depressed and every once in a while for no reason you got goose flesh while you walked
It didnt seem at all like Christmas was coming soon
It didnt seem like anything was coming
But I kept walking over to the Mall anyway because thats where Phoebe usually goes when shes in the park
She likes to skate near the bandstand
Its funny
Thats the same place I used to like to skate when I was a kid
When I got there though I didnt see her around anywhere
There were a few kids around skating and all and two boys were playing Flys Up with a soft ball but no Phoebe
I saw one kid about her age though sitting on a bench all by herself tightening her skate
I thought maybe she might know Phoebe and could tell me where she was or something so I went over and sat down next to her and asked her Do you know Phoebe Caulfield by any chance   Who she said
All she had on was jeans and about twenty sweaters
You could tell her mother made them for her because they were lumpy as hell
Phoebe Caulfield
She lives on Seventy-first Street
Shes in the fourth grade over at    You know Phoebe   Yeah Im her brother
You know where she is   Shes in Miss Callons class isnt she the kid said
I dont know
Yes I think she is
Shes probly in the museum then
We went last Saturday the kid said
Which museum I asked her
She shrugged her shoulders sort of
I dont know she said
The museum
I know but the one where the pictures are or the one where the Indians are   The one where the Indians
Thanks a lot I said
I got up and started to go but  then I suddenly remembered it was Sunday
This is Sunday I told the kid
She looked up at me
Oh
Then she isnt
She was having a helluva time tightening her skate
She didnt have any gloves on or anything and her hands were all red and cold
I gave her a hand with it
Boy I hadnt had a skate key in my hand for years
It didnt feel funny though
You could put a skate key in my hand fifty years from now in pitch dark and Id still know what it is
She thanked me and all when I had it tightened for her
She was a very nice polite little kid
God I love it when a kids nice and polite when you tighten their skate for them or something
Most kids are
They really are
I asked her if shed care to have a hot chocolate or something with me but she said no thank you
She said she had to meet her friend
Kids always have to meet their friend
That kills me
Even though it was Sunday and Phoebe wouldnt be there with her class or anything and even though it was so damp and lousy out I walked all the way through the park over to the Museum of Natural History
I knew that was the museum the kid with the skate key meant
I knew that whole museum routine like a book
Phoebe went to the same school I went to when I was a kid and we used to go there all the time
We had this teacher Miss Aigletinger that took us there damn near every Saturday
Sometimes we looked at the animals and sometimes we looked at the stuff the Indians had made in ancient times
Pottery and straw baskets and all stuff like that
I get very happy when I think about it
Even now
I remember after we looked at all the Indian stuff usually we went to see some movie in this big auditorium
Columbus
They were always showing
Columbus discovering America having one helluva time getting old Ferdinand and Isabella to lend him the dough to buy ships with and then the sailors mutinying on him and all
Nobody gave too much of a damn about old Columbus but you always had a lot of candy and gum and stuff with you and the inside of that auditorium had such a nice smell
It always smelled like it was raining outside even if it wasnt and you were in the only nice dry cosy place in the world
I loved that damn museum
I remember you had to go through the Indian Room to get to the auditorium
It was a long long room and you were only supposed to whisper
The teacher would go first then the class
Youd be two rows of kids and youd have a partner
Most of the time my partner was this girl named Gertrude Levine
She always wanted to hold your hand and her hand was always sticky or sweaty or something
The floor was all stone and if you had some marbles in your hand and you dropped them they bounced like madmen all over the floor and made a helluva racket and the teacher would hold up the class and go back and see what the hell was going on
She never got sore though Miss Aigletinger
Then youd pass by this long long Indian war canoe about as long as three goddam Cadillacs in a row with about twenty Indians in it some of them paddling some of them just standing around looking tough and they all had war paint all over their faces
There was one very spooky guy in the back of the canoe with a mask on
He was the witch doctor
He gave me the creeps but I liked him anyway
Another thing if you touched one of the paddles or anything while you were passing one of the guards would say to you Dont touch anything children but he always said it in a nice voice not like a goddam cop or anything
Then youd pass by this big glass case with Indians inside it rubbing sticks together to make a fire and a squaw weaving a blanket
The squaw that was weaving the blanket was sort of bending over and you could see her bosom and all
We all used to sneak a good look at it even the girls because they were only little kids and they didnt have any more bosom than we did
Then just before you went inside the auditorium right near the doors you passed this Eskimo
He was sitting over a hole in this icy lake and he was fishing through it
He had about two fish right next to the hole that hed already caught
Boy that museum was full of glass cases
There were even more upstairs with deer inside them drinking at water holes and birds flying south for the winter
The birds nearest you were all stuffed and hung up on wires and the ones in back were just painted on the wall but they all looked like they were really flying south and if you bent your head down and sort of looked at them upside down they looked in an even bigger hurry to fly south
The best thing though in that museum was that everything always stayed right where it was
Nobodyd move
You could go there a hundred thousand times and that Eskimo would still be just finished catching those two fish the birds would still be on their way south the deers would still be drinking out of that water hole with their pretty antlers and their pretty skinny legs and that squaw with the naked bosom would still be weaving that same blanket
Nobodyd be different
The only thing that would be different would be you
Not that youd be so much older or anything
It wouldnt be that exactly
Youd just be different thats all
Youd have an overcoat on this time
Or the kid that was your partner in line the last time had got scarlet fever and youd have a new partner
Or youd have a substitute taking the class instead of Miss Aigletinger
Or youd heard your mother and father having a terrific fight in the bathroom
Or youd just passed by one of those puddles in the street with gasoline rainbows in them
I mean youd be different in some way I cant explain what I mean
And even if I could Im not sure Id feel like it
I took my old hunting hat out of my pocket while I walked and put it on
I knew I wouldnt meet anybody that knew me and it was pretty damp out
I kept walking and walking and I kept thinking about old Phoebe going to that museum on Saturdays the way I used to
I thought how shed see the same stuff I used to see and how shed be different every time she saw it
It didnt exactly depress me to think about it but it didnt make me feel gay as hell either
Certain things they should stay the way they are
You ought to be able to stick them in one of those big glass cases and just leave them alone
I know thats impossible but its too bad anyway
Anyway I kept thinking about all that while I walked
I passed by this playground and stopped and watched a couple of very tiny kids on a seesaw
One of them was sort of fat and I put my hand on the skinny kids end to sort of even up the weight but you could tell they didnt want me around so I let them alone
Then a funny thing happened
When I got to the museum all of a sudden I wouldnt have gone inside for a million bucks
It just didnt appeal to me and here Id walked through the whole goddam park and looked forward to it and all
If Phoebed been there I probably would have but she wasnt
So all I did in front of the museum was get a cab and go down to the Biltmore
I didnt feel much like going
Id made that damn date with Sally though
I was way early when I got there so I just sat down on one of those leather couches right near the clock in the lobby and watched the girls
A lot of schools were home for vacation already and there were about a million girls sitting and standing around waiting for their dates to show up
Girls with their legs crossed girls with their legs not crossed girls with terrific legs girls with lousy legs girls that looked like swell girls girls that looked like theyd be bitches if you knew them
It was really nice sightseeing if you know what I mean
In a way it was sort of depressing too because you kept wondering what the hell would happen to all of them
When they got out of school and college I mean
You figured most of them would probably marry dopey guys
Guys that always talk about how many miles they get to a gallon in their goddam cars
Guys that get sore and childish as hell if you beat them at golf or even just some stupid game like ping-pong
Guys that are very mean
Guys that never read books
Guys that are very boring But I have to be careful about that
I mean about calling certain guys bores
I dont understand boring guys
I really dont
When I was at Elkton Hills I roomed for about two months with this boy Harris Mackim
He was very intelligent and all but he was one of the biggest bores I ever met
He had one of these very raspy voices and he never stopped talking practically
He never stopped talking and what was awful was he never said anything you wanted to hear in the first place
But he could do one thing
The sonuvabitch could whistle better than anybody I ever heard
Hed be making his bed or hanging up stuff in the closet he was always hanging up stuff in the closet it drove me crazy and hed be whistling while he did it if he wasnt talking in this raspy voice
He could even whistle classical stuff but most of the time he just whistled jazz
He could take something very jazzy like Tin Roof Blues and whistle it so nice and easy right
while he was hanging stuff up in the closet that it could kill you
Naturally I never told him I thought he was a terrific whistler
I mean you dont just go up to somebody and say Youre a terrific whistler
But I roomed with him for about two whole months even though he bored me till I was half crazy just because he was such a terrific whistler the best I ever heard
So I dont know about bores
Maybe you shouldnt feel too sorry if you see some swell girl getting married to them
They dont hurt anybody most of them and maybe theyre secretly all terrific whistlers or something
Who the hell knows Not me
Finally old Sally started coming up the stairs and I started down to meet her
She looked terrific
She really did
She had on this black coat and sort of a black beret
She hardly ever wore a hat but that beret looked nice
The funny part is I felt like marrying her the minute I saw her
Im crazy
I didnt even like her much and yet all of a sudden I felt like I was in love with her and wanted to marry her
I swear to God Im crazy
I admit it
Holden she said
Its marvelous to see you Its been ages
She had one of these very loud embarrassing voices when you met her somewhere
She got away with it because she was so damn good-looking but it always gave me a pain in the ass
Swell to see you I said
I meant it too
How are ya anyway   Absolutely marvelous
Am I late   I told her no but she was around ten minutes late as a matter of fact
I didnt give a damn though
All that crap they have in cartoons in the Saturday Evening Post and all showing guys on street corners looking sore as hell because their dates are late thats bunk
If a girl looks swell when she meets you who gives a damn if shes late Nobody
We better hurry I said
The show starts at two-forty
We started going down the stairs to where the taxis are
What are we going to see she said
I dont know
The Lunts
Its all I could get tickets for
The Lunts Oh marvelous I told you shed go mad when she heard it was for the Lunts
We horsed around a little bit in the cab on the way over to the theater
At first she didnt want to because she had her lipstick on and all but I was being seductive as hell and she didnt have any alternative
Twice when the goddam cab stopped short in traffic I damn near fell off the seat
Those damn drivers never even look where theyre going I swear they dont
Then just to show you how crazy I am when we were coming out of this big clinch I told her I loved her and all
It was a lie of course but the thing is I meant it when I said it
Im crazy
I swear to God I am
Oh darling I love you too she said
Then right in the same damn breath she said Promise me youll let your hair grow
Crew cuts are getting corny
And your hairs so lovely
Lovely my ass
The show wasnt as bad as some Ive seen
It was on the crappy side though
It was about five hundred thousand years in the life of this one old couple
It starts out when theyre young and all and the girls parents dont want her to marry the boy but she marries him anyway
Then they keep getting older and older
The husband goes to war and the wife has this brother thats a drunkard
I couldnt get very interested
I mean I didnt care too much when anybody in the family died or anything
They were all just a bunch of actors
The husband and wife were a pretty nice old couple very witty and all
but I couldnt get too interested in them
For one thing they kept drinking tea or some goddam thing all through the play
Every time you saw them some butler was shoving some tea in front of them or the wife was pouring it for somebody
And everybody kept coming in and going out all the time you got dizzy watching people sit down and stand up
Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne were the old couple and they were very good but I didnt like them much
They were different though Ill say that
They didnt act like people and they didnt act like actors
Its hard to explain
They acted more like they knew they were celebrities and all
I mean they were good but they were too good
When one of them got finished making a speech the other one said something very fast right after it
It was supposed to be like people really talking and interrupting each other and all
The trouble was it was too much like people talking and interrupting each other
They acted a little bit the way old Ernie down in the Village plays the piano
If you do something too good then after a while if you dont watch it you start showing off
And then youre not as good any more
But anyway they were the only ones in the show the Lunts I mean that looked like they had any real brains
I have to admit it
At the end of the first act we went out with all the other jerks for a cigarette
What a deal that was
You never saw so many phonies in all your life everybody smoking their ears off and talking about the play so that everybody could hear and know how sharp they were
Some dopey movie actor was standing near us having a cigarette
I dont know his name but he always plays the part of a guy in a war movie that gets yellow before its time to go over the top
He was with some gorgeous blonde and the two of them were trying to be very blasé and all like as if he didnt even know people were looking at him
Modest as hell
I got a big bang out of it
Old Sally didnt talk much except to rave about the Lunts because she was busy rubbering and being charming
Then all of a sudden she saw some jerk she knew on the other side of the lobby
Some guy in one of those very dark gray flannel suits and one of those checkered vests
Strictly Ivy League
Big deal
He was standing next to the wall smoking himself to death and looking bored as hell
Old Sally kept saying I know that boy from somewhere
She always knew somebody any place you took her or thought she did
She kept saying that till I got bored as hell and I said to her Why dont you go on over and give him a big soul kiss if you know him Hell enjoy it
She got sore when I said that
Finally though the jerk noticed her and came over and said hello
You shouldve seen the way they said hello
Youd have thought they hadnt seen each other in twenty years
Youd have thought theyd taken baths in the same bathtub or something when they were little kids
Old buddyroos
It was nauseating
The funny part was they probably met each other just once at some phony party
Finally when they were all done slobbering around old Sally introduced us
His name was George something I dont even remember and he went to Andover
Big big deal
You shouldve seen him when old Sally asked him how he liked the play
He was the kind of a phony that have to give themselves room when they answer somebodys question
He stepped back and stepped right on the ladys foot behind him
He probably broke every toe in her body
He said the play itself was no masterpiece but that the Lunts of course were absolute angels
Angels
For Chrissake
Angels
That killed me
Then he and old Sally started talking about a lot of people they both knew
It was the phoniest conversation you ever heard in your life
They both kept thinking of places as fast as they could then theyd think of somebody that lived there and mention their name
I was all set to puke when it was time to go sit down again
I really was
And then when
the next act was over they continued their goddam boring conversation
They kept thinking of more places and more names of people that lived there
The worst part was the jerk had one of those very phony Ivy League voices one of those very tired snobby voices
He sounded just like a girl
He didnt hesitate to horn in on my date the bastard
I even thought for a minute that he was going to get in the goddam cab with us when the show was over because he walked about two blocks with us but he had to meet a bunch of phonies for cocktails he said
I could see them all sitting around in some bar with their goddam checkered vests criticizing shows and books and women in those tired snobby voices
They kill me those guys
I sort of hated old Sally by the time we got in the cab after listening to that phony Andover bastard for about ten hours
I was all set to take her home and all I really was but she said I have a marvelous idea She was always having a marvelous idea
Listen she said
What time do you have to be home for dinner I mean are you in a terrible hurry or anything Do you have to be home any special time   Me No
No special time I said
Truer word was never spoken boy
Why   Lets go ice-skating at Radio City   Thats the kind of ideas she always had
Ice-skating at Radio City You mean right now   Just for an hour or so
Dont you want to If you dont want to    I didnt say I didnt want to I said
Sure
If you want to
Do you mean it Dont just say it if you dont mean it
I mean I dont give a darn one way or the other
Not much she didnt
You can rent those darling little skating skirts old Sally said
Jeannette Cultz did it last week
Thats why she was so hot to go
She wanted to see herself in one of those little skirts that just come down over their butt and all
So we went and after they gave us our skates they gave Sally this little blue butt-twitcher of a dress to wear
She really did look damn good in it though
I save to admit it
And dont think she didnt know it
The kept walking ahead of me so that Id see how cute her little ass looked
It did look pretty cute too
I have to admit it
The funny part was though we were the worst skaters on the whole goddam rink
I mean the worst
And there were some lulus too
Old Sallys ankles kept bending in till they were practically on the ice
They not only looked stupid as hell but they probably hurt like hell too
I know mine did
Mine were killing me
We mustve looked gorgeous
And what made it worse there were at least a couple of hundred rubbernecks that didnt have anything better to do than stand around and watch everybody falling all over themselves
Do you want to get a table inside and have a drink or something I said to her finally
Thats the most marvelous idea youve had all day the said
She was killing herself
It was brutal
I really felt sorry for her
We took off our goddam skates and went inside this bar where you can get drinks and watch the skaters in just your stocking feet
As soon as we sat down old Sally took off her gloves and I gave her a cigarette
She wasnt looking too happy
The waiter came up and I ordered a Coke for her she didnt drink and a Scotch and soda for myself but
the sonuvabitch wouldnt bring me one so I had a Coke too
Then I sort of started lighting matches
I do that quite a lot when Im in a certain mood
I sort of let them burn down till I cant hold them any more then I drop them in the ashtray
Its a nervous habit
Then all of a sudden out of a clear blue sky old Sally said Look
I have to know
Are you or arent you coming over to help me trim the tree Christmas Eve I have to know
She was still being snotty on account of her ankles when she was skating
I wrote you I would
Youve asked me that about twenty times
Sure I am
I mean I have to know she said
She started looking all around the goddam room
All of a sudden I quit lighting matches and sort of leaned nearer to her over the table
I had quite a few topics on my mind
Hey Sally I said
What she said
She was looking at some girl on the other side of the room
Did you ever get fed up I said
I mean did you ever get scared that everything was going to go lousy unless you did something I mean do you like school and all that stuff   Its a terrific bore
I mean do you hate it I know its a terrific bore but do you hate it is what I mean
Well I dont exactly hate it
You always have to    Well I hate it
Boy do I hate it I said
But it isnt just that
Its everything
I hate living in New York and all
Taxicabs and Madison Avenue buses with the drivers and all always yelling at you to get out at the rear door and being introduced to phony guys that call the Lunts angels and going up and down in elevators when you just want to go outside and guys fitting your pants all the time at Brooks and people always    Dont shout please old Sally said
Which was very funny because I wasnt even shouting
Take cars I said
I said it in this very quiet voice
Take most people theyre crazy about cars
They worry if they get a little scratch on them and theyre always talking about how many miles they get to a gallon and if they get a brand-new car already they start thinking about trading it in for one thats even newer
I dont even like old cars
I mean they dont even interest me
Id rather have a goddam horse
A horse is at least human for Gods sake
A horse you can at least    I dont know what youre even talking about old Sally said
You jump from one    You know something I said
Youre probably the only reason Im in New York right now or anywhere
If you werent around Id probably be someplace way the hell off
In the woods or some goddam place
Youre the only reason Im around practically
Youre sweet she said
But you could tell she wanted me to change the damn subject
You ought to go to a boys school sometime
Try it sometime I said
Its full of phonies and all you do is study so that you can learn enough to be smart enough to be able to buy a goddam Cadillac some day and you have to keep making believe you give a damn if the football team loses and all you do is talk about girls and liquor and sex all day and everybody sticks together in these dirty little goddam cliques
The guys that are on the basketball team stick together the Catholics stick together the goddam
intellectuals stick together the guys that play bridge stick together
Even the guys that belong to the goddam Book-of-the-Month Club stick together
If you try to have a little intelligent    Now listen old Sally said
Lots of boys get more out of school than that
I agree I agree they do some of them But thats all I get out of it
See Thats my point
Thats exactly my goddam point I said
I dont get hardly anything out of anything
Im in bad shape
Im in lousy shape
You certainly are
Then all of a sudden I got this idea
Look I said
Heres my idea
How would you like to get the hell out of here Heres my idea
I know this guy down in Greenwich Village that we can borrow his car for a couple of weeks
He used to go to the same school I did and he still owes me ten bucks
What we could do is tomorrow morning we could drive up to Massachusetts and Vermont and all around there see
Its beautiful as hell up there It really is
I was getting excited as hell the more I thought of it and I sort of reached over and took old Sallys goddam hand
What a goddam fool I was
No kidding I said
I have about a hundred and eighty bucks in the bank
I can take it out when it opens in the morning and then I could go down and get this guys car
No kidding
Well stay in these cabin camps and stuff like that till the dough runs out
Then when the dough runs out I could get a job somewhere and we could live somewhere with a brook and all and later on we could get married or something
I could chop all our own wood in the wintertime and all
Honest to God we could have a terrific time Wuddaya say Cmon Wuddaya say Will you do it with me Please   You cant just do something like that old Sally said
She sounded sore as hell
Why not Why the hell not   Stop screaming at me please she said
Which was crap because I wasnt even screaming at her
Why cantcha Why not   Because you cant thats all
In the first place were both practically children
And did you ever stop to think what youd do if you didnt get a job when your money ran out Wed starve to death
The whole things so fantastic it isnt even    It isnt fantastic
Id get a job
Dont worry about that
You dont have to worry about that
Whats the matter Dont you want to go with me Say so if you dont
It isnt that
It isnt that at all old Sally said
I was beginning to hate her in a way
Well have oodles of time to do those things all those things
I mean after you go to college and all and if we should get married and all
Therell be oodles of marvelous places to go to
Youre just    No there wouldnt be
There wouldnt be oodles of places to go to at all
Itd be entirely different I said
I was getting depressed as hell again
What she said
I cant hear you
One minute you scream at me and the next you    I said no there wouldnt be marvelous places to go to after I went to college and all
Open your ears
Itd be entirely different
Wed have to go downstairs in elevators with suitcases and stuff
Wed have to phone up everybody and tell em good-by and send em postcards from hotels and all
And Id be working in some office making a lot of dough and riding to work in cabs and Madison Avenue buses and reading newspapers
and playing bridge all the time and going to the movies and seeing a lot of stupid shorts and coming attractions and newsreels
Newsreels
Christ almighty
Theres always a dumb horse race and some dame breaking a bottle over a ship and some chimpanzee riding a goddam bicycle with pants on
It wouldnt be the same at all
You dont see what I mean at all
Maybe I dont Maybe you dont either old Sally said
We both hated each others guts by that time
You could see there wasnt any sense trying to have an intelligent conversation
I was sorry as hell Id started it
Cmon lets get outa here I said
You give me a royal pain in the ass if you want to know the truth
Boy did she hit the ceiling when I said that
I know I shouldntve said it and I probably wouldntve ordinarily but she was depressing the hell out of me
Usually I never say crude things like that to girls
Boy did she hit the ceiling
I apologized like a madman but she wouldnt accept my apology
She was even crying
Which scared me a little bit because I was a little afraid shed go home and tell her father I called her a pain in the ass
Her father was one of those big silent bastards and he wasnt too crazy about me anyhow
He once told old Sally I was too goddam noisy
No kidding
Im sorry I kept telling her
Youre sorry
Youre sorry
Thats very funny she said
She was still sort of crying and all of a sudden I did feel sort of sorry Id said it
Cmon Ill take ya home
No kidding
I can go home by myself thank you
If you think Id let you take me home youre mad
No boy ever said that to me in my entire life
The whole thing was sort of funny in a way if you thought about it and all of a sudden I did something I shouldnt have
I laughed
And I have one of these very loud stupid laughs
I mean if I ever sat behind myself in a movie or something Id probably lean over and tell myself to please shut up
It made old Sally madder than ever
I stuck around for a while apologizing and trying to get her to excuse me but she wouldnt
She kept telling me to go away and leave her alone
So finally I did it
I went inside and got my shoes and stuff and left without her
I shouldntve but I was pretty goddam fed up by that time
If you want to know the truth I dont even know why I started all that stuff with her
I mean about going away somewhere to Massachusetts and Vermont and all
I probably wouldntve taken her even if shed wanted to go with me
She wouldnt have been anybody to go with
The terrible part though is that I meant it when I asked her
Thats the terrible part
I swear to God Im a madman
When I left the skating rink I felt sort of hungry so I went in this drugstore and had a Swiss cheese sandwich and a malted and then I went in a phone booth
I thought maybe I might give old Jane another buzz and see if she was home yet
I mean I had the whole evening free and I thought Id give her a buzz and if she was home yet take her dancing or something somewhere
I never danced with her or anything the whole time I knew her
I saw her dancing once though
She looked like a very good dancer
It was at
this Fourth of July dance at the club
I didnt know her too well then and I didnt think I ought to cut in on her date
She was dating this terrible guy Al Pike that went to Choate
I didnt know him too well but he was always hanging around the swimming pool
He wore those white Lastex kind of swimming trunks and he was always going off the high dive
He did the same lousy old half gainer all day long
It was the only dive he could do but he thought he was very hot stuff
All muscles and no brains
Anyway thats who Jane dated that night
I couldnt understand it
I swear I couldnt
After we started going around together I asked her how come she could date a showoff bastard like Al Pike
Jane said he wasnt a show-off
She said he had an inferiority complex
She acted like she felt sorry for him or something and she wasnt just putting it on
She meant it
Its a funny thing about girls
Every time you mention some guy thats strictly a bastard very mean or very conceited and all and when you mention it to the girl shell tell you he has an inferiority complex
Maybe he has but that still doesnt keep him from being a bastard in my opinion
Girls
You never know what theyre going to think
I once got this girl Roberta Walshs roommate a date with a friend of mine
His name was Bob Robinson and he really had an inferiority complex
You could tell he was very ashamed of his parents and all because they said he dont and she dont and stuff like that and they werent very wealthy
But he wasnt a bastard or anything
He was a very nice guy
But this Roberta Walshs roommate didnt like him at all
She told Roberta he was too conceited and the reason she thought he was conceited was because he happened to mention to her that he was captain of the debating team
A little thing like that and she thought he was conceited The trouble with girls is if they like a boy no matter how big a bastard he is theyll say he has an inferiority complex and if they dont like him no matter how nice a guy he is or how big an inferiority complex he has theyll say hes conceited
Even smart girls do it
Anyway I gave old Jane a buzz again but her phone didnt answer so I had to hang up
Then I had to look through my address book to see who the hell might be available for the evening
The trouble was though my address book only has about three people in it
Jane and this man Mr Antolini that was my teacher at Elkton Hills and my fathers office number
I keep forgetting to put peoples names in
So what I did finally I gave old Carl Luce a buzz
He graduated from the Whooton School after I left
He was about three years older than I was and I didnt like him too much but he was one of these very intellectual guys  he had the highest I
Q
of any boy at Whooton and I thought he might want to have dinner with me somewhere and have a slightly intellectual conversation
He was very enlightening sometimes
So I gave him a buzz
He went to Columbia now but he lived on 65th Street and all and I knew hed be home
When I got him on the phone he said he couldnt make it for dinner but that hed meet me for a drink at ten oclock at the Wicker Bar on 54th
I think he was pretty surprised to hear from me
I once called him a fat-assed phony
I had quite a bit of time to kill till ten oclock so what I did I went to the movies at Radio City
It was probably the worst thing I couldve done but it was near and I couldnt think of anything else
I came in when the goddam stage show was on
The Rockettes were kicking their heads off the way they do when theyre all in line with their arms around each others waist
The audience applauded like mad and some guy behind me kept saying to his wife You know what that is Thats precision
He killed me
Then after the Rockettes
a guy came out in a tuxedo and roller skates on and started skating under a bunch of little tables and telling jokes while he did it
He was a very good skater and all but I couldnt enjoy it much because I kept picturing him practicing to be a guy that roller-skates on the stage
It seemed so stupid
I guess I just wasnt in the right mood
Then after him they had this Christmas thing they have at Radio City every year
All these angels start coming out of the boxes and everywhere guys carrying crucifixes and stuff all over the place and the whole bunch of them thousands of them singing Come All Ye Faithful like mad
Big deal
Its supposed to be religious as hell I know and very pretty and all but I cant see anything religious or pretty for Gods sake about a bunch of actors carrying crucifixes all over the stage
When they were all finished and started going out the boxes again you could tell they could hardly wait to get a cigarette or something
I saw it with old Sally Hayes the year before and she kept saying how beautiful it was the costumes and all
I said old Jesus probably wouldve puked if He could see it all those fancy costumes and all
Sally said I was a sacrilegious atheist
I probably am
The thing Jesus really wouldve liked would be the guy that plays the kettle drums in the orchestra
Ive watched that guy since I was about eight years old
My brother Allie and I if we were with our parents and all we used to move our seats and go way down so we could watch him
Hes the best drummer I ever saw
He only gets a chance to bang them a couple of times during a whole piece but he never looks bored when he isnt doing it
Then when he does bang them he does it so nice and sweet with this nervous expression on his face
One time when we went to Washington with my father Allie sent him a postcard but Ill bet he never got it
We werent too sure how to address it
After the Christmas thing was over the goddam picture started
It was so putrid I couldnt take my eyes off it
It was about this English guy Alec something that was in the war and loses his memory in the hospital and all
He comes out of the hospital carrying a cane and limping all over the place all over London not knowing who the hell he is
Hes really a duke but he doesnt know it
Then he meets this nice homey sincere girl getting on a bus
Her goddam hat blows off and he catches it and then they go upstairs and sit down and start talking about Charles Dickens
Hes both their favorite author and all
Hes carrying this copy of Oliver Twist and sos she
I couldve puked
Anyway they fell in love right away on account of theyre both so nuts about Charles Dickens and all and he helps her run her publishing business
Shes a publisher the girl
Only shes not doing so hot because her brothers a drunkard and he spends all their dough
Hes a very bitter guy the brother because he was a doctor in the war and now he cant operate any more because his nerves are shot so he boozes all the time but hes pretty witty and all
Anyway old Alec writes a book and this girl publishes it and they both make a hatful of dough on it
Theyre all set to get married when this other girl old Marcia shows up
Marcia was Alecs fiancée before he lost his memory and she recognizes him when hes in this store autographing books
She tells old Alec hes really a duke and all but he doesnt believe her and doesnt want to go with her to visit his mother and all
His mothers blind as a bat
But the other girl the homey one makes him go
Shes very noble and all
So he goes
But he still doesnt get his memory back even when his great Dane jumps all over him and his mother sticks her fingers all over his face and brings him this teddy bear he used to slobber around with when he was a kid
But then one day some kids are playing cricket on the lawn and he gets smacked in the head with a cricket ball
Then right away he gets his goddam memory back and he goes in and
kisses his mother on the forehead and all
Then he starts being a regular duke again and he forgets all about the homey babe that has the publishing business
Id tell you the rest of the story but I might puke if I did
It isnt that Id spoil it for you or anything
There isnt anything to spoil for Chrissake
Anyway it ends up with Alec and the homey babe getting married and the brother thats a drunkard gets his nerves back and operates on Alecs mother so she can see again and then the drunken brother and old Marcia go for each other
It ends up with everybody at this long dinner table laughing their asses off because the great Dane comes in with a bunch of puppies
Everybody thought it was a male I suppose or some goddam thing
All I can say is dont see it if you dont want to puke all over yourself
The part that got me was there was a lady sitting next to me that cried all through the goddam picture
The phonier it got the more she cried
Youd have thought she did it because she was kindhearted as hell but I was sitting right next to her and she wasnt
She had this little kid with her that was bored as hell and had to go to the bathroom but she wouldnt take him
She kept telling him to sit still and behave himself
She was about as kindhearted as a goddam wolf
You take somebody that cries their goddam eyes out over phony stuff in the movies and nine times out of ten theyre mean bastards at heart
Im not kidding
After the movie was over I started walking down to the Wicker Bar where I was supposed to meet old Carl Luce and while I walked I sort of thought about war and all
Those war movies always do that to me
I dont think I could stand it if I had to go to war
I really couldnt
It wouldnt be too bad if theyd just take you out and shoot you or something but you have to stay in the Army so goddam long
Thats the whole trouble
My brother DB was in the Army for four goddam years
He was in the war too he landed on D-Day and all but I really think he hated the Army worse than the war
I was practically a child at the time but I remember when he used to come home on furlough and all all he did was lie on his bed practically
He hardly ever even came in the living room
Later when he went overseas and was in the war and all he didnt get wounded or anything and he didnt have to shoot anybody
All he had to do was drive some cowboy general around all day in a command car
He once told Allie and I that if hed had to shoot anybody he wouldntve known which direction to shoot in
He said the Army was practically as full of bastards as the Nazis were
I remember Allie once asked him wasnt it sort of good that he was in the war because he was a writer and it gave him a lot to write about and all
He made Allie go get his baseball mitt and then he asked him who was the best war poet Rupert Brooke or Emily Dickinson
Allie said Emily Dickinson
I dont know too much about it myself because I dont read much poetry but I do know itd drive me crazy if I had to be in the Army and be with a bunch of guys like Ackley and Stradlater and old Maurice all the time marching with them and all
I was in the Boy Scouts once for about a week and I couldnt even stand looking at the back of the guys neck in front of me
They kept telling you to look at the back of the guys neck in front of you
I swear if theres ever another war they better just take me out and stick me in front of a firing squad
I wouldnt object
What gets me about DB though he hated the war so much and yet he got me to read this book A Farewell to Arms last summer
He said it was so terrific
Thats what I cant understand
It had this guy in it named Lieutenant Henry that was supposed to be a nice guy and all
I dont see how DB could hate the Army and war and all so much and still like a phony like that
I mean for instance I dont
see how he could like a phony book like that and still like that one by Ring Lardner or that other one hes so crazy about The Great Gatsby
DB got sore when I said that and said I was too young and all to appreciate it but I dont think so
I told him I liked Ring Lardner and The Great Gatsby and all
I did too
I was crazy about The Great Gatsby
Old Gatsby
Old sport
That killed me
Anyway Im sort of glad theyve got the atomic bomb invented
If theres ever another war Im going to sit right the hell on top of it
Ill volunteer for it I swear to God I will
In case you dont live in New York the Wicker Bar is in this sort of swanky hotel the Seton Hotel
I used to go there quite a lot but I dont any more
I gradually cut it out
Its one of those places that are supposed to be very sophisticated and all and the phonies are coming in the window
They used to have these two French babes Tina and Janine come out and play the piano and sing about three times every night
One of them played the piano strictly lousy and the other one sang and most of the songs were either pretty dirty or in French
The one that sang old Janine was always whispering into the goddam microphone before she sang
Shed say And now we like to geeve you our impression of Vooly Voo Fransay
Eet ees the story of a leetle Fransh girl who comes to a beeg ceety just like New York and falls een love wees a leetle boy from Brookleen
We hope you like eet
Then when she was all done whispering and being cute as hell shed sing some dopey song half in English and half in French and drive all the phonies in the place mad with joy
If you sat around there long enough and heard all the phonies applauding and all you got to hate everybody in the world I swear you did
The bartender was a louse too
He was a big snob
He didnt talk to you at all hardly unless you were a big shot or a celebrity or something
If you were a big shot or a celebrity or something then he was even more nauseating
Hed go up to you and say with this big charming smile like he was a helluva swell guy if you knew him Well Hows Connecticut or Hows Florida It was a terrible place Im not kidding
I cut out going there entirely gradually
It was pretty early when I got there
I sat down at the bar it was pretty crowded and had a couple of Scotch and sodas before old Luce even showed up
I stood up when I ordered them so they could see how tall I was and all and not think I was a goddam minor
Then I watched the phonies for a while
Some guy next to me was snowing hell out of the babe he was with
He kept telling her she had aristocratic hands
That killed me
The other end of the bar was full of flits
They werent too flitty-looking I mean they didnt have their hair too long or anything but you could tell they were flits anyway
Finally old Luce showed up
Old Luce
What a guy
He was supposed to be my Student Adviser when I was at Whooton
The only thing he ever did though was give these sex talks and all late at night when there was a bunch of guys in his room
He knew quite a bit about sex especially perverts and all
He was always telling us about a lot of creepy guys that go around having affairs with sheep and guys that go around with girls pants sewed in the lining of their hats and all
And flits and Lesbians
Old Luce knew who every flit and Lesbian in the United States was
All you had to do was mention somebody anybody and old Luced tell you if he was a flit or not
Sometimes it was hard to believe the
people he said were flits and Lesbians and all movie actors and like that
Some of the ones he said were flits were even married for Gods sake
Youd keep saying to him You mean Joe Blows a flit Joe Blow That big tough guy that plays gangsters and cowboys all the time Old Luced say Certainly
He was always saying Certainly
He said it didnt matter if a guy was married or not
He said half the married guys in the world were flits and didnt even know it
He said you could turn into one practically overnight if you had all the traits and all
He used to scare the hell out of us
I kept waiting to turn into a flit or something
The funny thing about old Luce I used to think he was sort of flitty himself in a way
He was always saying Try this for size and then hed goose the hell out of you while you were going down the corridor
And whenever he went to the can he always left the goddam door open and talked to you while you were brushing your teeth or something
That stuffs sort of flitty
It really is
Ive known quite a few real flits at schools and all and theyre always doing stuff like that and thats why I always had my doubts about old Luce
He was a pretty intelligent guy though
He really was
He never said hello or anything when he met you
The first thing he said when he sat down was that he could only stay a couple of minutes
He said he had a date
Then he ordered a dry Martini
He told the bartender to make it very dry and no olive
Hey I got a flit for you I told him
At the end of the bar
Dont look now
I been saving him for ya
Very funny he said
Same old Caulfield
When are you going to grow up   I bored him a lot
I really did
He amused me though
He was one of those guys that sort of amuse me a lot
Hows your sex life I asked him
He hated you to ask him stuff like that
Relax he said
Just sit back and relax for Chrissake
Im relaxed I said
Hows Columbia Ya like it   Certainly I like it
If I didnt like it I wouldnt have gone there he said
He could be pretty boring himself sometimes
Whatre you majoring in I asked him
Perverts I was only horsing around
Whatre you trying to be funny   No
Im only kidding I said
Listen hey Luce
Youre one of these intellectual guys
I need your advice
Im in a terrific    He let out this big groan on me
Listen Caulfield
If you want to sit here and have a quiet peaceful drink and a quiet peaceful conver    All right all right I said
Relax
You could tell he didnt feel like discussing anything serious with me
Thats the trouble with these intellectual guys
They never want to discuss anything serious unless they feel like it
So all I did was I started discussing topics in general with him
No kidding hows your sex life I asked him
You still going around with that same babe you used to at Whooton The one with the terrffic    Good God no he said
How come What happened to her   I havent the faintest idea
For all I know since you ask shes probably the Whore of New Hampshire by this time
That isnt nice
If she was decent enough to let you get sexy with her all the time you at least shouldnt talk about her that way
Oh God old Luce said
Is this going to be a typical Caulfield conversation I want to know right now
No I said but it isnt nice anyway
If she was decent and nice enough to let you    Must we pursue this horrible trend of thought   I didnt say anything
I was sort of afraid hed get up and leave on me if I didnt shut up
So all I did was I ordered another drink
I felt like getting stinking drunk
Whore you going around with now I asked him
You feel like telling me   Nobody you know
Yeah but who I might know her
Girl lives in the Village
Sculptress
If you must know
Yeah No kidding How old is she   Ive never asked her for Gods sake
Well around how old   I should imagine shes in her late thirties old Luce said
In her late thirties Yeah You like that I asked him
You like em that old The reason I was asking was because he really knew quite a bit about sex and all
He was one of the few guys I knew that did
He lost his virginity when he was only fourteen in Nantucket
He really did
I like a mature person if thats what you mean
Certainly
You do Why No kidding they better for sex and all   Listen
Lets get one thing straight
I refuse to answer any typical Caulfield questions tonight
When in hell are you going to grow up   I didnt say anything for a while
I let it drop for a while
Then old Luce ordered another Martini and told the bartender to make it a lot dryer
Listen
How long you been going around with her this sculpture babe I asked him
I was really interested
Did you know her when you were at Whooton   Hardly
She just arrived in this country a few months ago
She did Wheres she from   She happens to be from Shanghai
No kidding She Chinese for Chrissake  Obviously
No kidding Do you like that Her being Chinese  Obviously
Why Id be interested to know I really would
I simply happen to find Eastern philosophy more satisfactory than Western
Since you ask
You do Wuddaya mean philosophy Ya mean sex and all You mean its better in China That what you mean   Not necessarily in China for Gods sake
The East I said
Must we go on with this inane conversation   Listen Im serious I said
No kidding
Whys it better in the East   Its too involved to go into for Gods sake old Luce said
They simply happen to regard sex as both a physical and a spiritual experience
If you think Im 
So do I So do I regard it as a wuddayacallit a physical and spiritual experience and all
I really do
But it depends on who the hell Im doing it with
If Im doing it with somebody I dont even    Not so loud for Gods sake Caulfield
If you cant manage to keep your voice down lets drop the whole    All right but listen I said
I was getting excited and I was talking a little too loud
Sometimes I talk a little loud when I get excited
This is what I mean though I said
I know its supposed to be physical and spiritual and artistic and all
But what I mean is you cant do it with everybody every girl you neck  with and all and make it come out that way
Can you   Lets drop it old Luce said
Do you mind   All right but listen
Take you and this Chinese babe
Whats so good about you two   Drop it I said
I was getting a little too personal
I realize that
But that was one of the annoying things about Luce
When we were at Whooton hed make you describe the most personal stuff that happened to you but if you started asking him questions about himself he got sore
These intellectual guys dont like to have an intellectual conversation with you unless theyre running the whole thing
They always want you to shut up when they shut up and go back to your room when they go back to their room
When I was at Whooton old Luce used to hate it you really could tell he did when after he was finished giving his sex talk to a bunch of us in his room we stuck around and chewed the fat by ourselves for a while
I mean the other guys and myself
In somebody elses room
Old Luce hated that
He always wanted everybody to go back to their own room and shut up when he was finished being the big shot
The thing he was afraid of he was afraid somebodyd say something smarter than he had
He really amused me
Maybe Ill go to China
My sex life is lousy I said
Naturally
Your mind is immature
It is
It really is
I know it I said
You know what the trouble with me is I can never get really sexy I mean really sexy with a girl I dont like a lot
I mean I have to like her a lot
If I dont I sort of lose my goddam desire for her and all
Boy it really screws up my sex life something awful
My sex life stinks
Naturally it does for Gods sake
I told you the last time I saw you what you need
You mean to go to a psychoanalyst and all I said
Thats what hed told me I ought to do
His father was a psychoanalyst and all
Its up to you for Gods sake
Its none of my goddam business what you do with your life
I didnt say anything for a while
I was thinking
Supposing I went to your father and had him psychoanalyze me and all I said
What would he do to me I mean what would he do to me   He wouldnt do a goddam thing to you
Hed simply talk to you and youd talk to him for Gods sake
For one thing hed help you to recognize the patterns of your mind
The what
The patterns of your mind
Your mind runs in  Listen
Im not giving an elementary course in psychoanalysis
If youre interested call him up and make an appointment
If youre not dont
I couldnt care less frankly
I put my hand on his shoulder
Boy he amused me
Youre a real friendly bastard I told him
You know that   He was looking at his wrist watch
I have to tear he said and stood up
Nice seeing you
He got the bartender and told him to bring him his check
Hey I said just before he beat it
Did your father ever psychoanalyze you   Me Why do you ask   No reason
Did he though Has he   Not exactly
Hes helped me to adjust myself to a certain extent but an extensive analysis hasnt been necessary
Why do you ask   No reason
I was just wondering
Well
Take it easy he said
He was leaving his tip and all and he was starting to go
Have just one more drink I told him
Please
Im lonesome as hell
No kidding
He said he couldnt do it though
He said he was late now and then he left
Old Luce
He was strictly a pain in the ass but he certainly had a good vocabulary
He had the largest vocabulary of any boy at Whooton when I was there
They gave us a test
I kept sitting there getting drunk and waiting for old Tina and Janine to come out and do their stuff but they werent there
A flitty-looking guy with wavy hair came out and played the piano and then this new babe Valencia came out and sang
She wasnt any good but she was better than old Tina and Janine and at least she sang good songs
The piano was right next to the bar where I was sitting and all and old Valencia was standing practically right next to me
I sort of gave her the old eye but she pretended she didnt even see me
I probably wouldnt have done it but I was getting drunk as hell
When she was finished she beat it out of the room so fast I didnt even get a chance to invite her to join me for a drink so I called the headwaiter over
I told him to ask old Valencia if shed care to join me for a drink
He said he would but he probably didnt even give her my message
People never give your message to anybody
Boy I sat at that goddam bar till around one oclock or so getting drunk as a bastard
I could hardly see straight
The one thing I did though I was careful as hell not to get boisterous or anything
I didnt want anybody to notice me or anything or ask how old I was
But boy I could hardly see straight
When I was really drunk I started that stupid business with the bullet in my guts again
I was the only guy at the bar with a bullet in their guts
I kept putting my hand under my jacket on my stomach and all to keep the blood from dripping all over the place
I didnt want anybody to know I was even wounded
I was concealing the fact that I was a wounded sonuvabitch
Finally what I felt like I felt like giving old Jane a buzz and see if she was home yet
So I paid my
check and all
Then I left the bar and went out where the telephones were
I kept keeping my hand under my jacket to keep the blood from dripping
Boy was I drunk
But when I got inside this phone booth I wasnt much in the mood any more to give old Jane a buzz
I was too drunk I guess
So what I did I gave old Sally Hayes a buzz
I had to dial about twenty numbers before I got the right one
Boy was I blind
Hello I said when somebody answered the goddam phone
I sort of yelled it I was so drunk
Who is this this very cold ladys voice said
This is me
Holden Caulfield
Lemme speaka Sally please
Sallys asleep
This is Sallys grandmother
Why are you calling at this hour Holden Do you know what time it is   Yeah
Wanna talka Sally
Very important
Put her on
Sallys asleep young man
Call her tomorrow
Good night
Wake er up Wake er up hey
Attaboy
Then there was a different voice
Holden this is me
It was old Sally
Whats the big idea   Sally That you   Yes stop screaming
Are you drunk   Yeah
Listen
Listen hey

Okay Trimma goddarn tree for ya

Me myself and I
Boy was I drunk I was even still holding onto my guts
They got me

You know that Sally you know that    I cant hear you
Go to bed now
I have to go
Call me tomorrow
Hey Sally You want me trimma tree for ya Ya want me to Huh   Yes
Good night
Go home and go to bed
She hung up on me
Gnight
Gnight Sally baby
Sally sweetheart darling I said
Can you imagine how drunk I was I hung up too then
I figured she probably just came home from a date
I pictured her out with the Lunts and all somewhere and that Andover jerk
All of them swimming around in a goddam pot of tea and saying sophisticated stuff to each other and being charming and phony
I wished to God I hadnt even phoned her
When Im drunk Im a madman
I stayed in the damn phone booth for quite a while
I kept holding onto the phone sort of so I wouldnt pass out
I wasnt feeling too marvelous to tell you the truth
Finally though I came out and went in the mens room staggering around like a moron and filled one of the washbowls with cold water
Then I dunked my head in it right up to the ears
I didnt even bother to dry it or anything
I just let the sonuvabitch drip
Then I walked over to this radiator by the window and sat down on it
It was nice and warm
It felt good because I was shivering like a bastard
Its a funny thing I always shiver like hell when Im drunk
I didnt have anything else to do so I kept sitting on the radiator and counting these little white squares on the floor
I was getting soaked
About a gallon of water was
dripping down my neck getting all over my collar and tie and all but I didnt give a damn
I was too drunk to give a damn
Then pretty soon the guy that played the piano for old Valencia this very wavyhaired flitty-looking guy came in to comb his golden locks
We sort of struck up a conversation while he was combing it except that he wasnt too goddam friendly
Hey
You gonna see that Valencia babe when you go back in the bar I asked him
Its highly probable he said
Witty bastard
All I ever meet is witty bastards
Listen
Give her my compliments
Ask her if that goddam waiter gave her my message willya   Why dont you go home Mac How old are you anyway   Eighty-six
Listen
Give her my compliments
Okay   Why dont you go home Mac   Not me
Boy you can play that goddam piano
I told him
I was just flattering him
He played the piano stinking if you want to know the truth
You oughta go on the radio I said
Handsome chap like you
All those goddam golden locks
Ya need a manager   Go home Mac like a good guy
Go home and hit the sack
No home to go to
No kidding you need a manager   He didnt answer me
He just went out
He was all through combing his hair and patting it and all so he left
Like Stradlater
All these handsome guys are the same
When theyre done combing their goddam hair they beat it on you
When I finally got down off the radiator and went out to the hat-check room I was crying and all
I dont know why but I was
I guess it was because I was feeling so damn depressed and lonesome
Then when I went out to the checkroom I couldnt find my goddam check
The hat-check girl was very nice about it though
She gave me my coat anyway
And my Little Shirley Beans record I still had it with me and all
I gave her a buck for being so nice but she wouldnt take it
She kept telling me to go home and go to bed
I sort of tried to make a date with her for when she got through working but she wouldnt do it
She said she was old enough to be my mother and all
I showed her my goddam gray hair and told her I was forty-two I was only horsing around naturally
She was nice though
I showed her my goddam red hunting hat and she liked it
She made me put it on before I went out because my hair was still pretty wet
She was all right
I didnt feel too drunk any more when I went outside but it was getting very cold out again and my teeth started chattering like hell
I couldnt make them stop
I walked over to Madison Avenue and started to wait around for a bus because I didnt have hardly any money left and I had to start economizing on cabs and all
But I didnt feel like getting on a damn bus
And besides I didnt even know where I was supposed to go
So what I did I started walking over to the park
I figured Id go by that little lake and see what the hell the ducks were doing see if they were around or not I still didnt know if they were around or not
It wasnt far over to the park and I didnt have anyplace else special to go to I didnt even know where I was going to sleep yet so I went
I wasnt tired or anything
I just felt blue as hell
Then something terrible happened just as I got in the park
I dropped old Phoebes record
It broke-into about fifty pieces
It was in a big envelope and all but it broke
anyway
I damn near cried it made me feel so terrible but all I did was I took the pieces out of the envelope and put them in my coat pocket
They  werent any good for anything but I didnt feel like  just throwing them away
Then I went in the park
Boy was it dark
Ive lived in New York all my life and I know Central Park like the back of my hand because I used to roller-skate there all the time and ride my bike when I was a kid but I had the most terrific trouble finding that lagoon that night
I knew right where it was it was right near Central Park South and all but I still couldnt find it
I mustve been drunker than I thought
I kept walking and walking and it kept getting darker and darker and spookier and spookier
I didnt see one person the whole time I was in the park
Im just as glad
I probably wouldve jumped about a mile if I had
Then finally I found it
What it was it was partly frozen and partly not frozen
But I didnt see any ducks around
I walked all around the whole damn lake I damn near fell in once in fact but I didnt see a single duck
I thought maybe if there were any around they might be asleep or something near the edge of the water near the grass and all
Thats how I nearly fell in
But I couldnt find any
Finally I sat down on this bench where it wasnt so goddam dark
Boy I was still shivering like a bastard and the back of my hair even though I had my hunting hat on was sort of full of little hunks of ice
That worried me
I thought probably Id get pneumonia and die
I started picturing millions of jerks coming to my funeral and all
My grandfather from Detroit that keeps calling out the numbers of the streets when you ride on a goddam bus with him and my aunts I have about fifty aunts and all my lousy cousins
What a mobd be there
They all came when Allie died the whole goddam stupid bunch of them
I have this one stupid aunt with halitosis that kept saying how peaceful he looked lying there DB told me
I wasnt there
I was still in the hospital
I had to go to the hospital and all after I hurt my hand
Anyway I kept worrying that I was getting pneumonia with all those hunks of ice in my hair and that I was going to die
I felt sorry as hell for my mother and father
Especially my mother because she still isnt over my brother Allie yet
I kept picturing her not knowing what to do with all my suits and athletic equipment and all
The only good thing I knew she wouldnt let old Phoebe come to my goddam funeral because she was only a little kid
That was the only good part
Then I thought about the whole bunch of them sticking me in a goddam cemetery and all with my name on this tombstone and all
Surrounded by dead guys
Boy when youre dead they really fix you up
I hope to hell when I do die somebody has sense enough to just dump me in the river or something
Anything except sticking me in a goddam cemetery
People coming and putting a bunch of flowers on your stomach on Sunday and all that crap
Who wants flowers when youre dead Nobody
When the weathers nice my parents go out quite frequently and stick a bunch of flowers on old Allies grave
I went with them a couple of times but I cut it out
In the first place I certainly dont enjoy seeing him in that crazy cemetery
Surrounded by dead guys and tombstones and all
It wasnt too bad when the sun was out but twice twice we were there when it started to rain
It was awful
It rained on his lousy tombstone and it rained on the grass on his stomach
It rained all over the place
All the visitors that were visiting the cemetery started running like hell over to their cars
Thats what nearly drove me crazy
All the visitors could get in their cars and turn on their radios and all and then go someplace nice for dinner everybody except Allie
I couldnt stand it
I know its only his body and all thats in the cemetery and his souls in Heaven and all that crap but I
couldnt stand it anyway
I just wish he wasnt there
You didnt know him
If youd known him youd know what I mean
Its not too bad when the suns out but the sun only comes out when it feels like coming out
After a while just to get my mind off getting pneumonia and all I took out my dough and tried to count it in the lousy light from the street lamp
All I had was three singles and five quarters and a nickel left boy I spent a fortune since I left Pencey
Then what I did I went down near the lagoon and I sort of skipped the quarters and the nickel across it where it wasnt frozen
I dont know why I did it but I did it
I guess I thought itd take my mind off getting pneumonia and dying
It didnt though
I started thinking how old Phoebe would feel if I got pneumonia and died
It was a childish way to think but I couldnt stop myself
Shed feel pretty bad if something like that happened
She likes me a lot
I mean shes quite fond of me
She really is
Anyway I couldnt get that off my mind so finally what I figured Id do I figured Id better sneak home and see her in case I died and all
I had my door key with me and all and I figured what Id do Id sneak in the apartment very quiet and all and just sort of chew the fat with her for a while
The only thing that worried me was our front door
It creaks like a bastard
Its a pretty old apartment house and the superintendents a lazy bastard and everything creaks and squeaks
I was afraid my parents might hear me sneaking in
But I decided Id try it anyhow
So I got the hell out of the park and went home
I walked all the way
It wasnt too far and I wasnt tired or even drunk any more
It was just very cold and nobody around anywhere
The best break I had in years when I got home the regular night elevator boy Pete wasnt on the car
Some new guy Id never seen was on the car so I figured that if I didnt bump smack into my parents and all Id be able to say hello to old Phoebe and then beat it and nobodyd even know Id been around
It was really a terrific break
What made it even better the new elevator boy was sort of on the stupid side
I told him in this very casual voice to take me up to the Dicksteins
The Dicksteins were these people that had the other apartment on our floor
Id already taken off my hunting hat so as not to look suspicious or anything
I went in the elevator like I was in a terrific hurry
He had the elevator doors all shut and all and was all set to take me up and then he turned around and said They aint in
Theyre at a party on the fourteenth floor
Thats all right I said
Im supposed to wait for them
Im their nephew
He gave me this sort of stupid suspicious look
You better wait in the lobby fella he said
Id like to I really would I said
But I have a bad leg
I have to hold it in a certain position
I think Id better sit down in the chair outside their door
He didnt know what the hell I was talking about so all he said was Oh and took me up
Not bad boy
Its funny
All you have to do is say something nobody understands and theyll do practically anything you want them to
I got off at our floor limping like a bastard and started walking over toward the Dicksteins side
Then when I heard the elevator doors shut I turned around and went
over to our side
I was doing all right
I didnt even feel drunk anymore
Then I took out my door key and opened our door quiet as hell
Then very very carefully and all I went inside and closed the door
I really shouldve been a crook
It was dark as hell in the foyer naturally and naturally I couldnt turn on any lights
I had to be careful not to bump into anything and make a racket
I certainly knew I was home though
Our foyer has a funny smell that doesnt smell like anyplace else
I dont know what the hell it is
It isnt cauliflower and it isnt perfume I dont know what the hell it is but you always know youre home
I started to take off my coat and hang it up in the foyer closet but that closets full of hangers that rattle like madmen when you open the door so I left it on
Then I started walking very very slowly back toward old Phoebes room
I knew the maid wouldnt hear me because she had only one eardrum
She had this brother that stuck a straw down her ear when she was a kid she once told me
She was pretty deaf and all
But my parents especially my mother she has ears like a goddam bloodhound
So I took it very very easy when I went past their door
I even held my breath for Gods sake
You can hit my father over the head with a chair and he wont wake up but my mother all you have to do to my mother is cough somewhere in Siberia and shell hear you
Shes nervous as hell
Half the time shes up all night smoking cigarettes
Finally after about an hour I got to old Phoebes room
She wasnt there though
I forgot about that
I forgot she always sleeps in DBs room when hes away in Hollywood or some place
She likes it because its the biggest room in the house
Also because it has this big old madman desk in it that DB bought off some lady alcoholic in Philadelphia and this big gigantic bed thats about ten miles wide and ten miles long
I dont know where he bought that bed
Anyway old Phoebe likes to sleep in DBs room when hes away and he lets her
You ought to see her doing her homework or something at that crazy desk
Its almost as big as the bed
You can hardly see her when shes doing her homework
Thats the kind of stuff she likes though
She doesnt like her own room because its too little she says
She says she likes to spread out
That kills me
Whats old Phoebe got to spread out Nothing
Anyway I went into DBs room quiet as hell and turned on the lamp on the desk
Old Phoebe didnt even wake up
When the light was on and all I sort of looked at her for a while
She was laying there asleep with her face sort of on the side of the pillow
She had her mouth way open
Its funny
You take adults they look lousy when theyre asleep and they have their mouths way open but kids dont
Kids look all right
They can even have spit all over the pillow and they still look all right
I went around the room very quiet and all looking at stuff for a while
I felt swell for a change
I didnt even feel like I was getting pneumonia or anything any more
I just felt good for a change
Old Phoebes clothes were on this chair right next to the bed
Shes very neat for a child
I mean she doesnt just throw her stuff around like some kids
Shes no slob
She had the jacket to this tan suit my mother bought her in Canada hung up on the back of the chair
Then her blouse and stuff were on the seat
Her shoes and socks were on the floor right underneath the chair right next to each other
I never saw the shoes before
They were new
They were these dark brown loafers sort of like this pair I have and they went swell with that suit my mother bought her in Canada
My mother dresses her nice
She really does
My mother has terrific taste in some things
Shes no good at buying ice skates or anything like that but clothes shes perfect
I mean
Phoebe always has some dress on that can kill you
You take most little kids even if their parents are wealthy and all they usually have some terrible dress on
I wish you could see old Phoebe in that suit my mother bought her in Canada
Im not kidding
I sat down on old DBs desk and looked at the stuff on it
It was mostly Phoebes stuff from school and all
Mostly books
The one on top was called Arithmetic Is Fun I sort of opened the first page and took a look at it
This is what old Phoebe had on it:     PHOEBE WEATHERFIELD CAULFIELD      4B-1    That killed me
Her middle name is Josephine for Gods sake not Weatherfield
She doesnt like it though
Every time I see her shes got a new middle name for herself
The book underneath the arithmetic was a geography and the book under the geography was a speller
Shes very good in spelling
Shes very good in all her subjects but shes best in spelling
Then under the speller there were a bunch of notebooks
She has about five thousand notebooks
You never saw a kid with so many notebooks
I opened the one on top and looked at the first page
It had on it:      Bernice meet me at recess I have something     very very important to tell you
That was all there was on that page
The next one had on it:        Why has south eastern Alaska so many caning factories       Because theres so much salmon       Why has it valuable forests       because it has the right climate
What has our government done to make       life easier for the alaskan eskimos       look it up for tomorrow       Phoebe Weatherfield Caulfield       Phoebe Weatherfield Caulfield       Phoebe Weatherfield Caulfield       Phoebe W
Caulfield       Phoebe Weatherfield Caulfield Esq
Please pass to Shirley       Shirley you said you were sagitarius       but your only taurus bring your skates        when you come over to my house    I sat there on DBs desk and read the whole notebook
It didnt take me long and I can read that kind of stuff some kids notebook Phoebes or anybodys all day and all night long
Kids notebooks kill me
Then I lit another cigarette it was my last one
I mustve smoked about three cartons that day
Then finally I woke her up
I mean I couldnt sit there on that desk for the rest of my life and besides I was afraid my parents
might barge in on me all of a sudden and I wanted to at least say hello to her before they did
So I woke her up
She wakes up very easily
I mean you dont have to yell at her or anything
All you have to do practically is sit down on the bed and say Wake up Phoeb and bingo shes awake
Holden she said right away
She put her arms around my neck and all
Shes very affectionate
I mean shes quite affectionate for a child
Sometimes shes even too affectionate
I sort of gave her a kiss and she said Whenja get home7 She was glad as hell to see me
You could tell
Not so loud
Just now
How are ya anyway   Im fine
Did you get my letter I wrote you a five-page    Yeah not so loud
Thanks
She wrote me this letter
I didnt get a chance to answer it though
It was all about this play she was in in school
She told me not to make any dates or anything for Friday so that I could come see it
Hows the play I asked her
Whatd you say the name of it was   A Christmas Pageant for Americans
It stinks but Im Benedict Arnold
I have practically the biggest part she said
Boy was she wide-awake
She gets very excited when she tells you that stuff
It starts out when Im dying
This ghost comes in on Christmas Eve and asks me if Im ashamed and everything
You know
For betraying my country and everything
Are you coming to it She was sitting way the hell up in the bed and all
Thats what I wrote you about
Are you   Sure Im coming
Certainly Im coming
Daddy cant come
He has to fly to California she said
Boy was she wide-awake
It only takes her about two seconds to get wide-awake
She was sitting sort of kneeling way up in bed and she was holding my goddam hand
Listen
Mother said youd be home Wednesday she said
She said Wednesday
I got out early
Not so loud
Youll wake everybody up
What time is it They wont be home till very late Mother said
They went to a party in Norwalk Connecticut old Phoebe said
Guess what I did this afternoon What movie I saw
Guess   I dont know Listen
Didnt they say what time theyd    The Doctor old Phoebe said
Its a special movie they had at the Lister Foundation
Just this one day they had it today was the only day
It was all about this doctor in Kentucky and everything that sticks a blanket over this childs face thats a cripple and cant walk
Then they send him to jail and everything
It was excellent
Listen a second
Didnt they say what time theyd     He feels sorry for it the doctor
Thats why he sticks this blanket over her face and everything and makes her suffocate
Then they make him go to jail for life imprisonment but this child that he stuck the blanket over its head comes to visit him all the time and thanks him for what he did
He was a mercy killer
Only he knows he deserves to go to jail because a doctor isnt supposed to take things away from God
This girl in my classs mother took us
Alice Holmborg Shes my best friend
Shes the only girl in the whole    Wait a second willya I said
Im asking you a question
Did they say what time theyd be back or didnt they
No but not till very late
Daddy took the car and everything so they wouldnt have to worry about trains
We have a radio in it now Except that Mother said nobody can play it when the cars in traffic
I began to relax sort of
I mean I finally quit worrying about whether theyd catch me home or not
I figured the hell with it
If they did they did
You shouldve seen old Phoebe
She had on these blue pajamas with red elephants on the collars
Elephants knock her out
So it was a good picture huh I said
Swell except Alice had a cold and her mother kept asking her all the time if she felt grippy
Right in the middle of the picture
Always in the middle of something important her motherd lean all over me and everything and ask Alice if she felt grippy
It got on my nerves
Then I told her about the record
Listen I bought you a record I told her
Only I broke it on the way home
I took the pieces out of my coat pocket and showed her
I was plastered I said
Gimme the pieces she said
Im saving them
She took them right out of my hand and then she put them in the drawer of the night table
She kills me
DB coming home for Christmas I asked her
He may and he may not Mother said
It all depends
He may have to stay in Hollywood and write a picture about Annapolis
Annapolis for Gods sake   Its a love story and everything
Guess whos going to be in it What movie star
Guess   Im not interested
Annapolis for Gods sake
Whats DB know about Annapolis for Gods sake Whats that got to do with the kind of stories he writes I said
Boy that stuff drives me crazy
That goddam Hollywood
Whatd you do to your arm I asked her
I noticed she had this big hunk of adhesive tape on her elbow
The reason I noticed it her pajamas didnt have any sleeves
This boy Curtis Weintraub thats in my class pushed me while I was going down the stairs in the park she said
Wanna see She started taking the crazy adhesive tape off her arm
Leave it alone
Whyd he push you down the stairs   I dont know
I think he hates me old Phoebe said
This other girl and me Selma Atterbury put ink and stuff all over his windbreaker
That isnt nice
What are you a child for Gods sake   No but every time Im in the park he follows me everywhere
Hes always following me
He gets on my nerves
He probably likes you
Thats no reason to put ink all    I dont want him to like me she said
Then she started looking at me funny
Holden she said how come youre not home Wednesday  What   Boy you have to watch her every minute
If you dont think shes smart youre mad
How come youre not home Wednesday she asked me
You didnt get kicked out or anything did you   I told you
They let us out early
They let the whole 
You did get kicked out You did old Phoebe said
Then she hit me on the leg with her fist
She gets very fisty when she feels like it
You did Oh Holden She had her hand on her mouth and all
She gets very emotional I swear to God
Who said I got kicked out Nobody said I    You did
You did she said
Then she smacked me again with her fist
If you dont think that hurts youre  crazy
Daddyll kill you she said
Then she flopped on her stomach on the bed and put the goddam pillow over her head
She does that quite frequently
Shes a true madman sometimes
Cut it out now I said
Nobodys gonna kill me
Nobodys gonna even Cmon Phoeb take that goddam thing off your head
Nobodys gonna kill me
She wouldnt take it off though
You cant make her do something if she doesnt want to
All she kept saying was Daddy s gonna kill you
You could hardly understand her with that goddam pillow over her head
Nobodys gonna kill me
Use your head
In the first place Im going away
What I may do I may get a job on a ranch or something for a while
I know this guy whose grandfathers got a ranch in Colorado
I may get a job out there I said
Ill keep in touch with you and all when Im gone if I go
Cmon
Take that off your head
Cmon hey Phoeb
Please
Please willya   She wouldn t take it off though I tried pulling it off but shes strong as hell
You get tired fighting with her
Boy if she wants to keep a pillow over her head she keeps it
Phoebe please
Cmon outa there I kept saying
Cmon hey 
Hey Weatherfield
Cmon out
She wouldnt come out though
You cant even reason with her sometimes
Finally I got up and went out in the living room and got some cigarettes out of the box on the table and stuck some in my pocket
I was all out
When I came back she had the pillow off her head all right I knew she would but she still wouldnt look at me even though she was laying on her back and all
When I came around the side of the bed and sat down again she turned her crazy face the other way
She was ostracizing the hell out of me
Just like the fencing team at Pencey when I left all the goddam foils on the subway
Hows old Hazel Weatherfield I said
You write any new stories about her I got that one you sent me right in my suitcase
Its down at the station
Its very good
Daddyll kill you
Boy she really gets something on her mind when she gets something on her mind
No he wont
The worst hell do hell give me hell again and then hell send me to that goddam military school
Thats all hell do to me
And in the first place I wont even be around
Ill be away
Ill be Ill probably be in Colorado on this ranch
Dont make me laugh
You cant even ride a horse
Who cant Sure I can
Certainly I can
They can teach you in about two minutes I said
Stop picking at that
She was picking at that adhesive tape on her arm
Who gave you that haircut I asked her
I just noticed what a stupid haircut somebody gave her
It was way too short
None of your business she said
She can be very snotty sometimes
She can be quite snotty
I suppose you failed in every single subject again she said very snotty
It was sort of funny too in a way
She sounds like a goddam schoolteacher sometimes and shes only a little child
No I didnt I said
I passed English
Then just for the hell of it I gave her a pinch on the behind
It was sticking way out in the breeze the way she was laying on her side
She has hardly any behind
I didnt do it hard but she tried to hit my hand anyway but she missed
Then all of a sudden she said Oh why did you do it She meant why did I get the ax again
It made me sort of sad the way she said it
Oh God Phoebe dont ask me
Im sick of everybody asking me that I said
A million reasons why
It was one of the worst schools I ever went to
It was full of phonies
And mean guys
You never saw so many mean guys in your life
For instance if you were having a bull session in somebodys room and somebody wanted to come in nobodyd let them in if they were some dopey pimply guy
Everybody was always locking their door when somebody wanted to come in
And they had this goddam secret fraternity that I was too yellow not to join
There was this one pimply boring guy Robert Ackley that wanted to get in
He kept trying to join and they wouldnt let him
Just because he was boring and pimply
I dont even feel like talking about it
It was a stinking school
Take my word
Old Phoebe didnt say anything but she was listen ing
I could tell by the back of her neck that she was listening
She always listens when you tell her something
And the funny part is she knows half the time what the hell youre talking about
She really does
I kept talking about old Pencey
I sort of felt like it
Even the couple of nice teachers on the faculty they were phonies too I said
There was this one old guy Mr Spencer
His wife was always giving you hot chocolate and all that stuff and they were really pretty nice
But you shouldve seen him when the headmaster old Thurmer came in the history class and sat down in the back of the room
He was always coming in and sitting down in the back of the room for about a half an hour
He was supposed to be incognito or something
After a while hed be sitting back there and then hed start interrupting what old Spencer was saying to crack a lot of corny jokes
Old Spencerd practically kill himself chuckling and smiling and all like as if Thurmer was a goddam prince or something
Dont swear so much
It wouldve made you puke I swear it would I said
Then on Veterans Day
They have this day Veterans Day that all the jerks that graduated from Pencey around 1776 come back and walk all over the place with their wives and children and everybody
You shouldve seen this one old guy that was about fifty
What he did was he came in our room and knocked on the door and asked us if wed mind if he used the bathroom
The bathroom was at the end of the corridor I dont know why the hell he asked us
You know what he said He said he wanted to see if his initials were still in one of the can doors
What he did he carved his goddam stupid sad old initials in one of the can doors about ninety years ago and he wanted to see if they were still there
So my roommate and I walked him down to the bathroom and all and we had to stand there while he looked for his initials in all the can doors
He kept talking to us the whole time telling us how when he was at Pencey they were the happiest days of his life and giving
us a lot of advice for the future and all
Boy did he depress me I dont mean he was a bad guy he wasnt
But you dont have to be a bad guy to depress somebody you can be a good guy and do it
All you have to do to depress somebody is give them a lot of phony advice while youre looking for your initials in some can door thats all you have to do
I dont know
Maybe it wouldnt have been so bad if he hadnt been all out of breath
He was all out of breath from just climbing up the stairs and the whole time he was looking for his initials he kept breathing hard with his nostrils all funny and sad while he kept telling Stradlater and I to get all we could out of Pencey
God Phoebe I cant explain
I just didnt like anything that was happening at Pencey
I cant explain
Old Phoebe said something then but I couldnt hear her
She had the side of her mouth right smack on the pillow and I couldnt hear her
What I said
Take your mouth away
I cant hear you with your mouth that way
You dont like anything thats happening
It made me even more depressed when she said that
Yes I do
Yes I do
Sure I do
Dont say that
Why the hell do you say that   Because you dont
You dont like any schools
You dont like a million things
You dont
I do Thats where youre wrong thats exactly where youre wrong Why the hell do you have to say that I said
Boy was she depressing me
Because you dont she said
Name one thing
One thing One thing I like I said
Okay
The trouble was I couldnt concentrate too hot
Sometimes its hard to concentrate
One thing I like a lot you mean I asked her
She didnt answer me though
She was in a cockeyed position way the hell over the other side of the bed
She was about a thousand miles away
Cmon answer me I said
One thing I like a lot or one thing I just like   You like a lot
All right I said
But the trouble was I couldnt concentrate
About all I could think of were those two nuns that went around collecting dough in those beatup old straw baskets
Especially the one with the glasses with those iron rims
And this boy I knew at Elkton Hills
There was this one boy at Elkton Hills named James Castle that wouldnt take back something he said about this very conceited boy Phil Stabile
James Castle called him a very conceited guy and one of Stabiles lousy friends went and squealed on him to Stabile
So Stabile with about six other dirty bastards went down to James Castles room and went in and locked the goddam door and tried to make him take back what he said but he wouldnt do it
So they started in on him
I wont even tell you what they did to him its too repulsive but he still wouldnt take it back old James Castle
And you shouldve seen him
He was a skinny little weak-looking guy with wrists about as big as pencils
Finally what he did instead of taking back what he said he jumped out the window
I was in the shower and all and even I could hear him land outside
But I just thought something fell out the window a radio or a desk or something not a boy or anything
Then I heard everybody running through the corridor and down the stairs so I put on my bathrobe and I ran downstairs too and there was old James Castle laying right on the stone steps and all
He was dead and his teeth and blood were all over the place
and nobody would even go near him
He had on this turtleneck sweater Id lent him
All they did with the guys that were in the room with him was expel them
They didnt even go to jail
That was about all I could think of though
Those two nuns I saw at breakfast and this boy James Castle I knew at Elkton Hills
The funny part is I hardly even know James Castle if you want to know the truth
He was one of these very quiet guys
He was in my math class but he was way over on the other side of the room and he hardly ever got up to recite or go to the blackboard or anything
Some guys in school hardly ever get up to recite or go to the blackboard
I think the only time I ever even had a conversation with him was that time he asked me if he could borrow this turtleneck sweater I had
I damn near dropped dead when he asked me I was so surprised and all
I remember I was brushing my teeth in the can when he asked me
He said his cousin was coming in to take him for a drive and all
I didnt even know he knew I had a turtleneck sweater
All I knew about him was that his name was always right ahead of me at roll call
Cabel R
Cabel W
Castle Caulfield I can still remember it
If you want to know the truth I almost didnt lend him my sweater
Just because I didnt know him too well
What I said to old Phoebe
She said something to me but I didnt hear her
You cant even think of one thing
Yes I can
Yes I can
Well do it then
I like Allie I said
And I like doing what Im doing right now
Sitting here with you and talking and thinking about stuff and    Allies dead You always say that If somebodys dead and everything and in Heaven then it isnt really    I know hes dead Dont you think I know that I can still like him though cant I Just because somebodys dead you dont just stop liking them for Gods sake especially if they were about a thousand times nicer than the people you know thatre alive and all
Old Phoebe didnt say anything
When she cant think of anything to say she doesnt say a goddam word
Anyway I like it now I said
I mean right now
Sitting here with you and just chewing the fat and horsing    That isnt anything really   It is so something really Certainly it is Why the hell isnt it People never think anything is anything really
Im getting goddam sick of it   Stop swearing
All right name something else
Name something youd like to be
Like a scientist
Or a lawyer or something
I couldnt be a scientist
Im no good in science
Well a lawyer like Daddy and all
Lawyers are all right I guess but it doesnt appeal to me I said
I mean theyre all right if they go around saving innocent guys lives all the time and like that but you dont do that kind of stuff if youre a lawyer
All you do is make a lot of dough and play golf and play bridge and buy cars and drink Martinis and look like a hot-shot
And besides
Even if you did go around saving guys lives and all how would you know if you did it because you really wanted  to save guys lives or because you did it because what you really wanted to do was be a terrific lawyer with everybody slapping you on the
back and congratulating you in court when the goddam trial was over the reporters and everybody the way it is in the dirty movies How would you know you werent being a phony The trouble is you wouldnt
Im not too sure old Phoebe knew what the hell I was talking about
I mean shes only a little child and all
But she was listening at least
If somebody at least listens its not too bad
Daddys going to kill you
Hes going to kill you she said
I wasnt listening though
I was thinking about something else something crazy
You know what Id like to be I said
You know what Id like to be I mean if I had my goddam choice   What Stop swearing
You know that song If a body catch a body comin through the rye Id like    Its If a body meet a body coming through the rye old Phoebe said
Its a poem
By Robert Burns
I know its a poem by Robert Burns
She was right though
It is If a body meet a body coming through the rye
I didnt know it then though
I thought it was If a body catch a body I said
Anyway I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all
Thousands of little kids and nobodys around nobody big I mean except me
And Im standing on the edge of some crazy cliff
What I have to do I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff I mean if theyre running and they dont look where theyre going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them
Thats all Id do all day
Id just be the catcher in the rye and all
I know its crazy but thats the only thing Id really like to be
I know its crazy
Old Phoebe didnt say anything for a long time
Then when she said something all she said was Daddys going to kill you
I dont give a damn if he does I said
I got up from the bed then because what I wanted to do I wanted to phone up this guy that was my English teacher at Elkton Hills Mr Antolini
He lived in New York now
He quit Elkton Hills
He took this job teaching English at N
Y
U
I have to make a phone call I told Phoebe
Ill be right back
Dont go to sleep
I didnt want her to go to sleep while I was in the living room
I knew she wouldnt but I said it anyway just to make sure
While I was walking toward the door old Phoebe said Holden and I turned around
She was sitting way up in bed
She looked so pretty
Im taking belching lessons from this girl Phyllis Margulies she said
Listen
I listened and I heard something but it wasnt much
Good I said
Then I went out in the living room and called up this teacher I had Mr Antolini
I made it very snappy on the phone because I was afraid my parents would barge in on me right in the middle of it
They didnt though
Mr Antolini was very nice
He said I could come right over if I wanted to
I think I probably woke he and his wife up
because it took them a helluva long time to answer the phone
The first thing he asked me was if anything was wrong and I said no
I said Id flunked out of Pencey though
I thought I might as well tell him
He said Good God when I said that
He had a good sense of humor and all
He told me to come right over if I felt like it
He was about the best teacher I ever had Mr Antolini
He was a pretty young guy not much older than my brother DB and you could kid around with him without losing your respect for him
He was the one that finally picked up that boy that jumped out the window I told you about James Castle
Old Mr Antolini felt his pulse and all and then he took off his coat and put it over James Castle and carried him all the way over to the infirmary
He didnt even give a damn if his coat got all bloody
When I got back to DBs room old Phoebed turned the radio on
This dance music was coming out
Shed turned it on low though so the maid wouldnt hear it
You shouldve seen her
She was sitting smack in the middle of the bed outside the covers with her legs folded like one of those Yogi guys
She was listening to the music
She kills me
Cmon I said
You feel like dancing I taught her how to dance and all when she was a tiny little kid
Shes a very good dancer
I mean I just taught her a few things
She learned it mostly by herself
You cant teach somebody how to really dance
You have shoes on she said
Ill take em off
Cmon
She practically jumped off the bed and then she waited while I took my shoes off and then I danced with her for a while
Shes really damn good
I dont like people that dance with little kids because most of the time it looks terrible
I mean if youre out at a restaurant somewhere and you see some old guy take his little kid out on the dance floor
Usually they keep yanking the kids dress up in the back by mistake and the kid cant dance worth a damn anyway and it looks terrible but I dont do it out in public with Phoebe or anything
We just horse around in the house
Its different with her anyway because she can dance
She can follow anything you do
I mean if you hold her in close as hell so that it doesnt matter that your legs are so much longer
She stays right with you
You can cross over or do some corny dips or even jitterbug a little and she stays right with you
You can even tango for Gods sake
We danced about four numbers
In between numbers shes funny as hell
She stays right in position
She wont even talk or anything
You both have to stay right in position and wait for the orchestra to start playing again
That kills me
Youre not supposed to laugh or anything either
Anyway we danced about four numbers and then I turned off the radio
Old Phoebe jumped back in bed and got under the covers
Im improving arent I  she asked me
And how I said
I sat down next to her on the bed again
I was sort of out of breath
I was smoking so damn much I had hardly any wind
She wasnt even out of breath
Feel my forehead she said all of a sudden
Why   Feel it
Just feel it once
I felt it
I didnt feel anything though
Does it feel very feverish she said
No
Is it supposed to   Yes Im making it
Feel it again
I felt it again and I still didnt feel anything but I said I think its starting to now
I didnt want her to get a goddam inferiority complex
She nodded
I can make it go up to over the thermoneter
Thermometer
Who said so   Alice Holmborg showed me how
You cross your legs and hold your breath and think of something very very hot
A radiator or something
Then your whole forehead gets so hot you can burn somebodys hand
That killed me
I pulled my hand away from her forehead like I was in terrific danger
Thanks for telling me I said
Oh I wouldntve burned your hand
Idve stopped before it got too Shhh Then quick as hell she sat way the hell up in bed
She scared hell out of me when she did that
Whats the matter I said
The front door she said in this loud whisper
Its them   I quick jumped up and ran over and turned off the light over the desk
Then I jammed out my cigarette on my shoe and put it in my pocket
Then I fanned hell out of the air to get the smoke out I shouldnt even have been smoking for Gods sake
Then I grabbed my shoes and got in the closet and shut the door
Boy my heart was beating like a bastard
I heard my mother come in the room
Phoebe she said
Now stop that
I saw the light young lady
Hello I heard old Phoebe say
I couldnt sleep
Did you have a good time   Marvelous my mother said but you could tell she didnt mean it
She doesnt enjoy herself much when she goes out
Why are you awake may I ask Were you warm enough   I was warm enough I just couldnt sleep
Phoebe have you been smoking a cigarette in here Tell me the truth please young lady
What old Phoebe said
You heard me
I just lit one for one second
I just took one puff
Then I threw it out the window
Why may I ask   I couldnt sleep
I dont like that Phoebe
I dont like that at all my mother said
Do you want another blanket   No thanks
Gnight old Phoebe said
She was trying to get rid of her you could tell
How was the movie my mother said
Excellent
Except Alices mother
She kept leaning over and asking her if she felt grippy during the whole entire movie
We took a taxi home
Let me feel your forehead
I didnt catch anything
She didnt have anything
It was just her mother
Well
Go to sleep now
How was your dinner   Lousy Phoebe said
You heard what your father said about using that word
What was lousy about it You had a lovely lamb chop
I walked all over Lexington Avenue just to    The lamb chop was all right but Charlene always breathes on me whenever she puts something down
She breathes all over the food and everything
She breathes on everything
Well
Go to sleep
Give Mother a kiss
Did you say your prayers   I said them in the bathroom
Gnight   Good night
Go right to sleep now
I have a splitting headache my mother said
She gets headaches quite frequently
She really does
Take a few aspirins old Phoebe said
Holdenll be home on Wednesday wont he   So far as I know
Get under there now
Way down
I heard my mother go out and close the door
I waited a couple of minutes
Then I came out of the closet
I bumped smack into old Phoebe when I did it because it was so dark and she was out of bed and coming to tell me
I hurt you I said
You had to whisper now because they were both home
I gotta get a move on I said
I found the edge of the bed in the dark and sat down on it and started putting on my shoes
I was pretty nervous
I admit it
Dont go now Phoebe whispered
Waitll theyre asleep   No
Now
Nows the best time I said
Shell be in the bathroom and Daddyll turn on the news or something
Nows the best time
I could hardly tie my shoelaces I was so damn nervous
Not that they wouldve killed me or anything if theyd caught me home but it wouldve been very unpleasant and all
Where the hell are ya I said to old Phoebe
It was so dark I couldnt see her
Here
She was standing right next to me
I didnt even see her
I got my damn bags at the station I said
Listen
You got any dough Phoeb Im practically broke
Just my Christmas dough
For presents and all
I havent done any shopping at all yet
Oh
I didnt want to take her Christmas dough
You want some she said
I dont want to take your Christmas dough
I can lend you some she said
Then I heard her over at DBs desk opening a million drawers and feeling around with her hand
It was pitch-black it was so dark in the room
If you go away you wont see me in the play she said
Her voice sounded funny when she said it
Yes I will
I wont go way before that
You think I wanna miss the play I said
What Ill do Ill probably stay at Mr Antolinis house till maybe Tuesday night
Then Ill come home
If I get a chance Ill phone ya
Here old Phoebe said
She was trying to give me the dough but she couldnt find my hand
Where   She put the dough in my hand
Hey I dont need all this I said
Just give me two bucks is all
No kidding Here
I tried to give it back to her but she wouldnt take it
You can take it all
You can pay me back
Bring it to the play
How much is it for Gods sake   Eight dollars and eighty-five cents
Sixty-five cents
I spent some
Then all of a sudden I started to cry
I couldnt help it
I did it so nobody could hear me but I did it
It scared hell out of old Phoebe when I started doing it and she came over and tried to make me stop but once you get started you cant just stop on a goddam dime
I was still sitting on the edge of the bed when I did it and she put her old arm around my neck and I put my arm around her too but I still couldnt stop for a long time
I thought I was going to choke to death or something
Boy I scared hell out of poor old Phoebe
The damn window was open and everything and I could feel her shivering and all because all she had on was her pajamas
I tried to make her get back in bed but she wouldnt go
Finally I stopped
But it certainly took me a long long time
Then I finished buttoning my coat and all
I told her Id keep in touch with her
She told me I could sleep with her if I wanted to but I said no that Id better beat it that Mr Antolini was waiting for me and all
Then I took my hunting hat out of my coat pocket and gave it to her
She likes those kind of crazy hats
She didnt want to take it but I made her
Ill bet she slept with it on
She really likes those kind of hats
Then I told her again Id give her a buzz if I got a chance and then I left
It was a helluva lot easier getting out of the house than it was getting in for some reason
For one thing I didnt give much of a damn any more if they caught me
I really didnt
I figured if they caught me they caught me
I almost wished they did in a way
I walked all the way downstairs instead of taking the elevator
I went down the back stairs
I nearly broke my neck on about ten million garbage pails but I got out all right
The elevator boy didnt even see me
He probably still thinks Im up at the Dicksteins
Mr and Mrs Antolini had this very swanky apartment over on Sutton Place with two steps that you go down to get in the living room and a bar and all
Id been there quite a few times because after I left Elkton Hills Mr Antoilni came up to our house for dinner quite frequently to find out how I was getting along
He wasnt married then
Then when he got married I used to play tennis with he and Mrs Antolini quite frequently out at the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills Long Island
Mrs Antolini belonged there
She was lousy with dough
She was about sixty years older than Mr Antolini but they seemed to get along quite well
For one thing they were both very intellectual especially Mr Antolini except that he was more witty than intellectual when you were with him sort of like DB Mrs Antolini was mostly serious
She had asthma pretty bad
They both read all DBs stories Mrs Antolini too and when DB went to Hollywood Mr Antolini phoned him up and told him not to go
He went anyway though
Mr Antolini said that anybody that could write like DB had no business going out to Hollywood
Thats exactly what I said practically
I would have walked down to their house because I didnt want to spend any of Phoebes Christmas dough that I didnt have to but I felt funny when I got outside
Sort of dizzy
So I took a cab
I didnt want to but I did
I had a helluva time even finding a cab
Old Mr Antolini answered the door when I rang the bell after the elevator boy finally let me up the bastard
He had on his bathrobe and slippers and he had a highball in one hand
He was a pretty sophisticated guy and he was a pretty heavy drinker
Holden mboy he said
My God hes grown another twenty inches
Fine to see you
How are you Mr Antolini Hows Mrs Antolini   Were both just dandy
Lets have that coat
He took my coat off me and hung it up
I expected to see a day-old infant in your arms
Nowhere to turn
Snowflakes in your eyelashes
Hes a very witty guy sometimes
He turned around and yelled out to the kitchen Lillian Hows the coffee coming Lillian was Mrs Antolinis first name
Its all ready she yelled back
Is that Holden Hello Holden   Hello Mrs Antolini   You were always yelling when you were there
Thats because the both of them were never in the same room at the same time
It was sort of funny
Sit down Holden Mr Antolini said
You could tell he was a little oiled up
The room looked like theyd just had a party
Glasses were all over the place and dishes with peanuts in them
Excuse the appearance of the place he said
Weve been entertaining some Buffalo friends of Mrs Antolinis 
Some buffaloes as a matter of fact
I laughed and Mrs Antolini yelled something in to me from the kitchen but I couldnt hear her
Whatd she say I asked Mr Antolini
She said not to look at her when she comes in
She just arose from the sack
Have a cigarette
Are you smoking now   Thanks I said
I took a cigarette from the box he offered me
Just once in a while
Im a moderate smoker
Ill bet you are he said
He gave me a light from this big lighter off the table
So
You and Pencey are no longer one he said
He always said things that way
Sometimes it amused me a lot and sometimes it didnt
He sort of did it a little bit too much
I dont mean he wasnt witty or anything he was but sometimes it gets on your nerves when somebodys always saying things like So you and Pencey are no longer one
DB does it too much sometimes too
What was the trouble Mr Antolini asked me
Howd you do in English Ill show you the door in short order if you flunked English you little ace composition writer
Oh I passed English all right
It was mostly literature though
I only wrote about two compositions the whole term I said
I flunked Oral Expression though
They had this course you had to take Oral Expression
That I flunked
Why   Oh I dont know
I didnt feel much like going into It
I was still feeling sort of dizzy or something and I had a helluva headache all of a sudden
I really did
But you could tell he was interested so I told him a little bit about it
Its this course where each boy in class has to get up in class and make a speech
You know
Spontaneous and all
And if the boy digresses at all youre supposed to yell Digression at him as fast as you can
It just about drove me crazy
I got an F in it
Why   Oh I dont know
That digression business got on my nerves
I dont know
The trouble with me is I like it when somebody digresses
Its more interesting and all
You dont care to have somebody stick to the point when he tells you something   Oh sure I like somebody to stick to the point and all
But I dont like them to stick too much to the point
I dont know
I guess I dont like it when somebody sticks to the point all the time
The boys that got the best marks in Oral Expression were the ones that stuck to the point all the time I admit it
But there was this one boy Richard Kinsella
He didnt stick to the point too much and they were always yelling Digression at him
It was terrible because in the first place he was a very nervous guy I mean he was a very nervous guy and his lips were always shaking whenever it was his time to make a speech and you could hardly hear him if you were sitting way in the back of the room
When his lips sort of quit shaking a little bit though I liked his speeches better than anybody elses
He practically flunked the course though too
He got a D plus because they kept yelling Digression at him all the time
For instance he made this speech about this farm his father bought in Vermont
They kept yelling Digression at him the whole time he was making it and this teacher Mr Vinson gave him an F on it because he hadnt told what kind of animals and vegetables and stuff grew on the farm and all
What he did was Richard Kinsella hed start telling you all about that stuff then all of a sudden hed start telling you about this letter his mother got from his uncle and how his uncle got polio and all when he was forty-two years old and how he wouldnt let anybody come to see him in the hospital because he didnt want anybody to see him with a brace on
It didnt have much to do with the farm I admit it but it was nice
Its nice when somebody tells you about their uncle
Especially when they start out telling you about their fathers farm and then all of a sudden get more interested in their uncle
I mean its dirty to keep yelling Digression at him when hes all nice and excited
I dont know
Its hard to explain
I didnt feel too much like trying either
For one thing I had this terrific headache all of a sudden
I wished to God old Mrs Antolini would come in with the coffee
Thats something that annoys hell out of me I mean if somebody says the coffees all ready and it isnt
Holden
One short faintly stuffy pedagogical question
Dont you think theres a time and place for everything Dont you think if someone starts out to tell you about his fathers farm he should stick to his guns then get around to telling you about his uncles brace Or if his uncles brace is such a provocative subject shouldnt he have selected it in the first place as his subject not the farm   I didnt feel much like thinking and answering and all
I had a headache and I felt lousy
I even had sort of a stomach-ache if you want to know the truth
Yes I dont know
I guess he should
I mean I guess he shouldve picked his uncle as a subject instead of the farm if that interested him most
But what I mean is lots of time you dont know what interests you most till you start talking about something that doesnt interest you most
I mean you cant help it sometimes
What I think is youre supposed to leave somebody alone if hes at least being interesting and hes getting all excited about something
I like it when somebody gets excited about something
Its nice
You just didnt know this teacher Mr Vinson
He could drive you crazy sometimes him and the goddam class
I mean hed keep telling you to unify and simplify all the time
Some things you just cant do that to
I mean you cant hardly ever simplify and unify something just because somebody wants you to
You didnt know this guy Mr Vinson
I mean he was very intelligent and all but you could tell he didnt have too much brains
Coffee gentlemen finally Mrs Antolini said
She came in carrying this tray with coffee and cakes and stuff on it
Holden dont you even peek at me
Im a mess
Hello Mrs Antolini I said
I started to get up and all but Mr Antolini got hold of my jacket and pulled me back down
Old Mrs Antolinis hair was full of those iron curler jobs and she didnt have any lipstick or anything on
She didnt look too gorgeous
She looked pretty old and all
Ill leave this right here
Just dive in you two she said
She put the tray down on the cigarette table pushing all these glasses out of the way
Hows your mother Holden   Shes fine thanks
I havent seen her too recently but the last I    Darling if Holden needs anything everythings in the linen closet
The top shelf
Im going to bed
Im exhausted Mrs Antolini said
She looked it too
Can you boys make up the couch by yourselves   Well take care of everything
You run along to bed Mr Antolini said
He gave Mrs Antolini a kiss and she said good-by to me and went in the bedroom
They were always kissing each other a lot in public
I had part of a cup of coffee and about half of some cake that was as hard as a rock
All old Mr Antolini had was another highball though
He makes them strong too you could tell
He may get to be an alcoholic if he doesnt watch his step
I had lunch with your dad a couple of weeks ago he said all of a sudden
Did you know that   No I didnt
Youre aware of course that hes terribly concerned about you
I know it
I know he is I said
Apparently before he phoned me hed just had a long rather harrowing letter from your latest headmaster to the effect that you were making absolutely no effort at all
Cutting classes
Coming unprepared to all your classes
In general being an all-around    I didnt cut any classes
You werent allowed to cut any
There were a couple of them I didnt attend once in a while like that Oral Expression I told you about but I didnt cut any
I didnt feel at all like discussing it
The coffee made my stomach feel a little better but I still had this awful headache
Mr Antolini lit another cigarette
He smoked like a fiend
Then he said Frankly I dont know what the hell to say to you Holden
I know
Im very hard to talk to
I realize that
I have a feeling that youre riding for some kind of a terrible terrible fall
But I dont honestly know what kind
Are you listening to me  Yes
You could tell he was trying to concentrate and all
It may be the kind where at the age of thirty you sit in some bar hating everybody who comes in looking as if he might have played football in college
Then again you may pick up just enough education to hate people who say Its a secret between he and I
Or you may end up in some business office throwing paper clips at the nearest stenographer
I just dont know
But do you know what Im driving at at all   Yes
Sure I said
I did too
But youre wrong about that hating business
I mean about hating football players and all
You really are
I dont hate too many guys
What I may do I may hate them for a little while like this guy Stradlater I knew at Pencey and this other boy Robert Ackley
I hated them once in a while I admit it but it doesnt last too long is what I mean
After a while if I didnt see them if they didnt come in the room or if I didnt see them in the dining room for a couple of meals I sort of missed them
I mean I sort of missed them
Mr Antolini didnt say anything for a while
He got up and got another hunk of ice and put it in his drink then he sat down again
You could tell he was thinking
I kept wishing though that hed continue the conversation in the morning instead of now but he was hot
People are mostly hot to have a discussion when youre not
All right
Listen to me a minute now 
I may not word this as memorably as Id like to but Ill write you a letter about it in a day or two
Then you can get it all straight
But listen now anyway
He started concentrating again
Then he said This fall I think youre riding for its a special kind of fall a horrible kind
The man falling isnt permitted to feel or hear himself hit bottom
He just keeps falling and falling
The whole arrangements designed for men who at some time or other in their lives were looking for something their own environment couldnt supply them with
Or they thought their own environment couldnt supply them with
So they gave up looking
They gave it up before they ever really even got started
You follow me  Yes sir
Sure  Yes
He got up and poured some more booze in his glass
Then he sat down again
He didnt say anything for a long time
I dont want to scare you he said but I can very clearly see you dying nobly one way or another for some highly unworthy cause
He gave me a funny look
If I write something down for you will you read it carefully And keep it   Yes
Sure I said
I did too
I still have the paper he gave me
He went over to this desk on the other side of the room and without sitting down wrote something on a piece of paper
Then he came back and sat down with the paper in his hand
Oddly enough this wasnt written by a practicing poet
It was written by a psychoanalyst named Wilhelm Stekel
Heres what he Are you still with me   Yes sure I am
Heres what he said: The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one
He leaned over and handed it to me
I read it right when he gave it to me and then I thanked him and all and put it in my pocket
It was nice of him to go to all that trouble
It really was
The thing was though I didnt feel much like concentrating
Boy I felt so damn tired all of a sudden
You could tell he wasnt tired at all though
He was pretty oiled up for one thing
I think that one of these days he said youre going to have to find out where you want to go
And then youve got to start going there
But immediately
You cant afford to lose a minute
Not you
I nodded because he was looking right at me and all but I wasnt too sure what he was talking about
I was pretty sure I knew but I wasnt too positive at the time
I was too damn tired
And I hate to tell you he said but I think that once you have a fair idea where you want to go your first move will be to apply yourself in school
Youll have to
Youre a student whether the idea appeals to you or not
Youre in love with knowledge
And I think youll find once you get past all the Mr Vineses and their Oral Comp    Mr Vinsons I said
He meant all the Mr Vinsons not all the Mr Vineses
I shouldnt have interrupted him though
All right the Mr Vinsons
Once you get past all the Mr Vinsons youre going to start getting closer and closer that is if you want to and if you look for it and wait for it to the kind of information that will be very very dear to your heart
Among other things youll find that youre not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior
Youre by no means alone on that score youll be excited and stimulated to know
Many many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now
Happily some of them kept records of their troubles
Youll learn from them if you want to
Just as someday if you have something to offer someone will learn something from you
Its a beautiful reciprocal arrangement
And it isnt education
Its history
Its poetry
He stopped and took a big drink out of his highball
Then he started again
Boy he was really hot
I was glad I didnt try to stop him or anything
Im not trying to tell you he said that only educated and scholarly men are able to contribute something valuable to the world
Its not so
But I do say that educated and scholarly men if theyre brilliant and creative to begin with which unfortunately is rarely the case tend to leave infinitely more valuable records behind them than men do who are merely brilliant and creative
They tend to express themselves more clearly and they usually have a passion for following their thoughts through to the end
And most important nine times out of ten they have more humility than the unscholarly thinker
Do you follow me at all  Yes sir
He didnt say anything again for quite a while
I dont know if youve ever done it but its sort of hard to sit around waiting for somebody to say something when theyre thinking and all
It really is
I kept trying not to yawn
It wasnt that I was bored or anything I wasnt but I was so damn sleepy all of a sudden
Something else an academic education will do for you
If you go along with it any considerable distance itll begin to give you an idea what size mind you have
What itll fit and maybe what it wont
After a while youll have an idea what kind of thoughts your particular size mind should be wearing
For one thing it may save you an extraordinary amount of time trying on ideas that dont suit you arent becoming to you
Youll begin to know your true measurements and dress your mind accordingly
Then all of a sudden I yawned
What a rude bastard but I couldnt help it   Mr Antolini just laughed though
Cmon he said and got up
Well fix up the couch for you
I followed him and he went over to this closet and tried to take down some sheets and blankets and stuff that was on the top shelf but he couldnt do it with this highball glass in his hand
So he drank it and then put the glass down on the floor and then he took the stuff down
I helped him bring it over to the couch
We both made the bed together
He wasnt too hot at it
He didnt tuck anything in very tight
I didnt care though
I couldve slept standing up I was so tired
Howre all your women
Theyre okay
I was being a lousy conversationalist but I didnt feel like it
Hows Sally He knew old Sally Hayes
I introduced him once
Shes all right
I had a date with her this afternoon
Boy it seemed like twenty years ago We dont have too much in common any more
Helluva pretty girl
What about that other girl The one you told me about in Maine   Oh Jane Gallagher
Shes all right
Im probably gonna give her a buzz tomorrow
We were all done making up the couch then
Its all yours Mr Antolini said
I dont know what the hell youre going to do with those legs of yours
Thats all right
Im used to short beds I said
Thanks a lot sir
You and Mrs Antolini really saved my life tonight
You know where the bathroom is
If theres anything you want just holler
Ill be in the kitchen for a while will the light bother you   No heck no
Thanks a lot
All right
Good night handsome
Gnight sir
Thanks a lot
He went out in the kitchen and I went in the bathroom and got undressed and all
I couldnt brush my teeth because I didnt have any toothbrush with me
I didnt have any pajamas either and Mr Antolini forgot to lend me some
So I just went back in the living room and turned off this little lamp next to the couch and then I got in bed with just my shorts on
It was way too short for me the couch but I really couldve slept standing up without batting an eyelash
I laid awake for just a couple of seconds thinking about all that stuff Mr Antolinid told me
About finding out the size of your mind and all
He was really a pretty smart guy
But I couldnt keep my goddam eyes open and I fell asleep
Then something happened
I dont even like to talk about it
I woke up all of a sudden
I dont know what time it was or anything but I woke up
I felt something on my head some guys hand
Boy it really scared hell out of me
What it was it was Mr Antolinis hand
What he was doing was he was sitting on the floor right next to the couch in the dark and all and he was sort of petting me or patting me on the goddam head
Boy Ill bet I jumped about a thousand feet
What the hellya doing I said
Nothing Im simply sitting here admiring    Whatre ya doing anyway I said over again
I didnt know what the hell to say I mean I was embarrassed as hell
How bout keeping your voice down Im simply sitting here    I have to go anyway I said boy was I nervous I started putting on my damn pants in the dark
I could hardly get them on I was so damn nervous
I know more damn perverts at schools and all than anybody you ever met and theyre always being perverty when Im around
You have to go where Mr Antolini said
He was trying to act very goddam casual and cool and all but he wasnt any too goddam cool
Take my word
I left my bags and all at the station
I think maybe Id better go down and get them
I have all my stuff in them
Theyll be there in the morning
Now go back to bed
Im going to bed myself
Whats the matter with you
Nothings the matter its just that all my money and stuffs in one of my bags
Ill be right back
Ill get a cab and be right back I said
Boy I was falling all over myself in the dark
The thing is it isnt mine the money
Its my mothers and I    Dont be ridiculous Holden
Get back in that bed
Im going to bed myself
The money will be there safe and sound in the morn    No no kidding
I gotta get going
I really do
I was damn near all dressed already except that I couldnt find my tie
I couldnt remember where Id put my tie
I put on my jacket and all without it
Old Mr Antolini was sitting now in the big chair a little ways away from me watching me
It was dark and all and I couldnt see him so hot but I knew he was watching me all right
He was still boozing too
I could see his trusty highball glass in his hand
Youre a very very strange boy
I know it I said
I didnt even look around much for my tie
So I went without it
Good-by sir I said Thanks a lot
No kidding
He kept walking right behind me when I went to the front door and when I rang the elevator bell he stayed in the damn doorway
All he said was that business about my being a very very strange boy again
Strange my ass
Then he waited in the doorway and all till the goddam elevator came
I never waited so long for an elevator in my whole goddam life
I swear
I didnt know what the hell to talk about while I was waiting for the elevator and he kept standing there so I said Im gonna start reading some good books
I really am
I mean you had to say something
It was very embarrassing
You grab your bags and scoot right on back here again
Ill leave the door unlatched
Thanks a lot I said
Gby The elevator was finally there
I got in and went down
Boy I was shaking like a madman
I was sweating too
When something perverty like that happens I start sweating like a bastard
That kind of stuffs happened to me about twenty times since I was a kid
I cant stand it
When I got outside it was just getting light out
It  was pretty cold too but it felt good because I was sweating so much
I didnt know where the hell to go
I didnt want to go to another hotel and spend all Phoebes dough
So finally all I did was I walked over to Lexington and took the subway down to Grand Central
My bags were there and all and I figured Id sleep in that crazy waiting room where all the benches are
So thats what I did
It wasnt too bad for a while because there werent many people around and I could stick my feet up
But I dont feel much like discussing it
It wasnt too nice
Dont ever try it
I mean it
Itll depress you
I only slept till around nine oclock because a million people started coming in the waiting room and I had to take my feet down
I cant sleep so hot if I have to keep my feet on the floor
So I sat up
I still had that headache
It was even worse
And I think I was more depressed than I ever was in my whole life
I didnt want to but I started thinking about old Mr Antolini and I wondered what hed tell Mrs Antolini when she saw I hadnt slept there or anything
That part didnt worry me too much though because I knew Mr Antolini was very smart and that he could make up something to tell her
He could tell her Id gone home or something
That part didnt worry me much
But what did worry me was the part about how Id woke up and found him patting me on the head and all
I mean I wondered if just maybe I was wrong about thinking be was making a flitty pass at ne
I wondered if maybe he just liked to pat guys on the head when theyre asleep
I mean how can you tell about that stuff for sure You cant
I even started wondering if maybe I shouldve got my bags and gone back to his house the way Id said I would
I mean I started thinking that even if he was a flit he certainlyd been very nice to me
I thought how he hadnt minded it when Id called him up so late and how hed told me to come right over if I felt like it
And how he went to all that trouble giving me that advice about finding out the size of your mind and all and how he was the only guy thatd even gone near that boy James Castle I told you about when he was dead
I thought about all that stuff
And the more I thought about it the more depressed I got
I mean I started thinking maybe I shouldve gone back to his house
Maybe he was only patting my head just for the hell of it
The more I thought about it though the more depressed and screwed up about it I got
What made it even worse my eyes were sore as hell
They felt sore and burny from not getting too much sleep
Besides that I was getting sort of a cold and I didnt even have a goddam handkerchief with me
I had some in my suitcase but I didnt feel like taking it out of that strong box and opening it up right in public and all
There was this magazine that somebodyd left on the bench next to me so I started reading it thinking itd make me stop thinking about Mr Antolini and a million other things for at least a little while
But this damn article I started reading made me feel almost worse
It was all about hormones
It described how you should look your face and eyes and all if your hormones were in good shape and I didnt look that way at all
I looked exactly like the guy in the article with lousy hormones
So I started getting worried about my hormones
Then I read this other article about how you can tell if you have cancer or not
It said if you had any sores in your mouth that didnt heal pretty quickly it was a sign that you probably had cancer
Id had this sore on the inside of my lip for about two weeks
So figured I was getting cancer
That magazine was some little cheerer upper
I finally quit reading it and went outside for a walk
I figured Id be dead in a couple of months because I had cancer
I really did
I was even positive I would be
It certainly didnt make me feel too gorgeous
Itsort of looked like it was going to rain but I went for this walk anyway
For one thing I figured I ought to get some breakfast
I wasnt at all hungry but I figured I ought to at least eat something
I mean at least get something with some vitamins in it
So I started walking way over east where the pretty cheap restaurants are because I didnt want to spend a lot of dough
While I was walking I passed these two guys that were unloading this big Christmas tree off a truck
One guy kept saying to the other guy Hold the sonuvabitch up Hold it up for Chrissake It certainly was a gorgeous way to talk about a Christmas tree
It was sort of funny though in an awful way and I started to sort of laugh
It was about the worst thing I couldve done because the minute I started to laugh I thought I was going to vomit
I really did
I even started to but it went away
I dont know why
I mean I hadnt eaten anything unsanitary or like that and usually I have quite a strong
stomach
Anyway I got over it and I figured Id feel better if I had something to eat
So I went in this very cheap-looking restaurant and had doughnuts and coffee
Only I didnt eat the doughnuts
I couldnt swallow them too well
The thing is if you get very depressed about something its hard as hell to swallow
The waiter was very nice though
He took them back without charging me
I just drank the coffee
Then I left and started walking over toward Fifth Avenue
It was Monday and all and pretty near Christmas and all the stores were open
So it wasnt too bad walking on Fifth Avenue
It was fairly Christmasy
All those scraggy-looking Santa Clauses were standing on corners ringing those bells and the Salvation Army girls the ones that dont wear any lipstick or anything were tinging bells too
I sort of kept looking around for those two nuns Id met at breakfast the day before but I didnt see them
I knew I wouldnt because theyd told me theyd come to New York to be schoolteachers but I kept looking for them anyway
Anyway it was pretty Christmasy all of a sudden
A million little kids were downtown with their mothers getting on and off buses and coming in and out of stores
I wished old Phoebe was around
Shes not little enough any more to go stark staring mad in the toy department but she enjoys horsing around and looking at the people
The Christmas before last I took her downtown shopping with me
We had a helluva time
I think it was in Bloomingdales
We went in the shoe department and we pretended she old Phoebe  wanted to get a pair of those very high storm shoes the kind that have about a million holes to lace up
We had the poor salesman guy going crazy
Old Phoebe tried on about twenty pairs and each time the poor guy had to lace one shoe all the way up
It was a dirty trick but it killed old Phoebe
We finally bought a pair of moccasins and charged them
The salesman was very nice about it
I think he knew we were horsing around because old Phoebe always starts giggling
Anyway I kept walking and walking up Fifth Avenue without any tie on or anything
Then all of a sudden something very spooky started happening
Every time I came to the end of a block and stepped off the goddam curb I had this feeling that Id never get to the other side of the street
I thought Id just go down down down and nobodyd ever see me again
Boy did it scare me
You cant imagine
I started sweating like a bastard my whole shirt and underwear and everything
Then I started doing something else
Every time Id get to the end of a block Id make believe I was talking to my brother Allie
Id say to him Allie dont let me disappear
Allie dont let me disappear
Allie dont let me disappear
Please Allie
And then when Id reach the other side of the street without disappearing Id thank him
Then it would start all over again as soon as I got to the next corner
But I kept going and all
I was sort of afraid to stop I think I dont remember to tell you the truth
I know I didnt stop till I was way up in the Sixties past the zoo and all
Then I sat down on this bench
I could hardly get my breath and I was still sweating like a bastard
I sat there I guess for about an hour
Finally what I decided Id do I decided Id go away
I decided Id never go home again and Id never go away to another school again
I decided Id just see old Phoebe and sort of say good-by to her and all and give her back her Christmas dough and then Id start hitchhiking my way out West
What Id do I figured Id go down to the Holland Tunnel and bum a ride and then Id bum another one and another one and another one and in a few days Id be somewhere out West where it was very pretty and sunny and where nobodyd know me and Id get a job
I figured I could get a job at a filling station somewhere putting gas
and oil in peoples cars
I didnt care what kind of job it was though
Just so people didnt know me and I didnt know anybody
I thought what Id do was Id pretend I was one of those deaf-mutes
That way I wouldnt have to have any goddam stupid useless conversations with anybody
If anybody wanted to tell me something theyd have to write it on a piece of paper and shove it over to me
Theyd get bored as hell doing that after a while and then Id be through with having conversations for the rest of my life
Everybodyd think I was just a poor deaf-mute bastard and theyd leave me alone
Theyd let me put gas and oil in their stupid cars and theyd pay me a salary and all for it and Id build me a little cabin somewhere with the dough I made and live there for the rest of my life
Id build it right near the woods but not right in them because Id want it to be sunny as hell all the time
Id cook all my own food and later on if I wanted to get married or something Id meet this beautiful girl that was also a deaf-mute and wed get married
Shed come and live in my cabin with me and if she wanted to say anything to me shed have to write it on a goddam piece of paper like everybody else
If we had any children wed hide them somewhere
We could buy them a lot of books and teach them how to read and write by ourselves
I got excited as hell thinking about it
I really did
I knew the part about pretending I was a deaf-mute was crazy but I liked thinking about it anyway
But I really decided to go out West and all
All I wanted to do first was say good-by to old Phoebe
So all of a sudden I ran like a madman across the street I damn near got killed doing it if you want to know the truth and went in this stationery store and bought a pad and pencil
I figured Id write her a note telling her where to meet me so I could say good-by to her and give her back her Christmas dough and then Id take the note up to her school and get somebody in the principals office to give it to her
But I just put the pad and pencil in my pocket and started walking fast as hell up to her school I was too excited to write the note right in the stationery store
I walked fast because I wanted her to get the note before she went home for lunch and I didnt have any too much time
I knew where her school was naturally because I went there myself when I was a kid
When I got there it felt funny
I wasnt sure Id remember what it was like inside but I did
It was exactly the same as it was when I went there
They had that same big yard inside that was always sort of dark with those cages around the light bulbs so they wouldnt break if they got hit with a ball
They had those same white circles painted all over the floor for games and stuff
And those same old basketball rings without any nets just the backboards and the rings
Nobody was around at all probably because it wasnt recess period and it wasnt lunchtime yet
All I saw was one little kid a colored kid on his way to the bathroom
He had one of those wooden passes sticking out of his hip pocket the same way we used to have to show he had permission and all to go to the bathroom
I was still sweating but not so bad any more
I went over to the stairs and sat down on the first step and took out the pad and pencil Id bought
The stairs had the same smell they used to have when I went there
Like somebodyd just taken a leak on them
School stairs always smell like that
Anyway I sat there and wrote this note:   DEAR PHOEBE      I cant wait around till Wednesday any more so I will
probably hitch hike out west this afternoon
Meet me at the     Museum of art near the door at quarter past 12 if you can and I   will give you your Christmas dough back
I didnt spend much
Love        HOLDEN     Her school was practically right near the museum and she had to pass it on her way home for lunch anyway so I knew she could meet me all right
Then I started walking up the stairs to the principals office so I could give the note to somebody that would bring it to her in her classroom
I folded it about ten times so nobodyd open it
You cant trust anybody in a goddam school
But I knew theyd give it to her if I was her brother and all
While I was walking up the stairs though all of a sudden I thought I was going to puke again
Only I didnt
I sat down for a second and then I felt better
But while I was sitting down I saw something that drove me crazy
Somebodyd written Fuck you on the wall
It drove me damn near crazy
I thought how Phoebe and all the other little kids would see it and how theyd wonder what the hell it meant and then finally some dirty kid would tell them all cockeyed naturally what it meant and how theyd all think about it and maybe even worry about it for a couple of days
I kept wanting to kill whoeverd written it
I figured it was some perverty bum thatd sneaked in the school late at night to take a leak or something and then wrote it on the wall
I kept picturing myself catching him at it and how Id smash his head on the stone steps till he was good and goddam dead and bloody
But I knew too I wouldnt have the guts to do it
I knew that
That made me even more depressed
I hardly even had the guts to rub it off the wall with my hand if you want to know the truth
I was afraid some teacher would catch me rubbing it off and would think Id written it
But I rubbed it out anyway finally
Then I went on up to the principals office
The principal didnt seem to be around but some old lady around a hundred years old was sitting at a typewriter
I told her I was Phoebe Caulfields brother in 4B-1 and I asked her to please give Phoebe the note
I said it was very important because my mother was sick and wouldnt have lunch ready for Phoebe and that shed have to meet me and have lunch in a drugstore
She was very nice about it the old lady
She took the note off me and called some other lady from the next office and the other lady went to give it to Phoebe
Then the old lady that was around a hundred years old and I shot the breeze for a while She was pretty nice and I told her how Id gone there to school too and my brothers
She asked me where I went to school now and I told her Pencey and she said Pencey was a very good school
Even if Id wanted to I wouldnt have had the strength to straighten her out
Besides if she thought Pencey was a very good school let her think it
You hate to tell new stuff to somebody around a hundred years old
They dont like to hear it
Then after a while I left
It was funny
She yelled Good luck at me the same way old Spencer did when I left Pencey
God how I hate it when somebody yells Good luck at me when Im leaving somewhere
Its depressing
I went down by a different staircase and I saw another Fuck you on the wall
I tried to rub it off with my hand again but this one was scratched on with a knife or
something
It wouldnt come off
Its hopeless anyway
If you had a million years to do it in you couldnt rub out even half the Fuck you signs in the world
Its impossible
I looked at the clock in the recess yard and it was only twenty to twelve so I had quite a lot of time to kill before I met old Phoebe
But I just walked over to the museum anyway
There wasnt anyplace else to go
I thought maybe I might stop in a phone booth and give old Jane Gallagher a buzz before I started bumming my way west but I wasnt in the mood
For one thing I wasnt even sure she was home for vacation yet
So I just went over to the museum and hung around
While I was waiting around for Phoebe in the museum right inside the doors and all these two little kids came up to me and asked me if I knew where the mummies were
The one little kid the one that asked me had his pants open
I told him about it
So he buttoned them up right where he was standing talking to me he didnt even bother to go behind a post or anything
He killed me
I wouldve laughed but I was afraid Id feel like vomiting again so I didnt
Wherere the mummies fella the kid said again
Ya know   I horsed around with the two of them a little bit
The mummies Whatre they I asked the one kid
You know
The mummies them dead guys
That get buried in them toons and all
Toons
That killed me
He meant tombs
How come you two guys arent in school I said
No school tday the kid that did all the talking said
He was lying sure as Im alive the little bastard
I didnt have anything to do though till old Phoebe showed up so I helped them find the place where the mummies were
Boy I used to know exactly where they were but I hadnt been in that museum in years
You two guys so interested in mummies I said
Yeah
Cant your friend talk I said
He aint my friend
Hes my brudda
Cant he talk I looked at the one that wasnt doing any talking
Cant you talk at all I asked him
Yeah he said
I dont feel like it
Finally we found the place where the mummies were and we went in
You know how the Egyptians buried their dead I asked the one kid
Naa
Well you should
Its very interesting
They wrapped their faces up in these cloths that were treated with some secret chemical
That way they could be buried in their tombs for thousands of years and their faces wouldnt rot or anything
Nobody knows how to do it except the Egyptians
Even modern science
To get to where the mummies were you had to go down this very narrow sort of hall with stones on the side that theyd taken right out of this Pharaohs tomb and all
It was pretty spooky and you could tell the two hot-shots I was with werent enjoying it too much
They stuck close as hell to me and the one that didnt talk at all practically was holding onto my sleeve
Lets go he said to his brother
I seen em awreddy
Cmon hey
He turned around and beat it
Hes got a yella streak a mile wide the other one said
So long He beat it too
I was the only one left in the tomb then
I sort of liked it in a way
It was so nice and peaceful
Then all of a sudden youd never guess what I saw on the wall
Another Fuck you
It was written with a red crayon or something right under the glass part of the wall under the stones
Thats the whole trouble
You cant ever find a place thats nice and peaceful because there isnt any
You may think there is but once you get there when youre not looking somebodyll sneak up and write Fuck you right under your nose
Try it sometime
I think even if I ever die and they stick me in a cemetery and I have a tombstone and all itll say Holden Caulfield on it and then what year I was born and what year I died and then right under that itll say Fuck you
Im positive in fact
After I came out of the place where the mummies were I had to go to the bathroom
I sort of had diarrhea if you want to know the truth
I didnt mind the diarrhea part too much but something else happened
When I was coming out of the can right before I got to the door I sort of passed out
I was lucky though
I mean I couldve killed myself when I hit the floor but all I did was sort of land on my side
it was a funny thing though
I felt better after I passed out
I really did
My arm sort of hurt from where I fell but I didnt feel so damn dizzy any more
It was about ten after twelve or so then and so I went back and stood by the door and waited for old Phoebe
I thought how it might be the last time Id ever see her again
Any of my relatives I mean
I figured Id probably see them again but not for years
I might come home when I was about thirty-five
I figured in case somebody got sick and wanted to see me before they died but that would be the only reason Id leave my cabin and come back
I even started picturing how it would be when I came back
I knew my motherd get nervous as hell and start to cry and beg me to stay home and not go back to my cabin but Id go anyway
Id be casual as hell
Id make her calm down and then Id go over to the other side of the living room and take out this cigarette case and light a cigarette cool as all hell
Id ask them all to visit me sometime if they wanted to but I wouldnt insist or anything
What Id do Id let old Phoebe come out and visit me in the summertime and on Christmas vacation and Easter vacation
And Id let DB come out and visit me for a while if he wanted a nice quiet place for his writing but he couldnt write any movies in my cabin only stories and books
Id have this rule that nobody could do anything phony when they visited me
If anybody tried to do anything phony they couldnt stay
All of a sudden I looked at the clock in the checkroom and it was twenty-five of one
I began to get scared that maybe that old lady in the school had told that other lady not to give old Phoebe my message
I began to get scared that maybe shed told her to burn it or something
It really scared hell out of me
I really wanted to see old Phoebe before I hit the road
I mean I had her Christmas dough and all
Finally I saw her
I saw her through the glass part of the door
The reason I saw her she had my crazy hunting hat on you could see that hat about ten miles away
I went out the doors and started down these stone stairs to meet her
The thing I couldnt understand she had this big suitcase with her
She was just coming across Fifth Avenue and she was dragging this goddam big suitcase with her
She could hardly drag it
When I got up closer I saw it was my old suitcase the one I used to use when I was at Whooton
I couldnt figure out what the hell she was doing with it
Hi she said when she got up close
She was all out of breath from that crazy suitcase
I thought maybe you werent coming I said
What the hells in that bag I dont need anything
Im just going the way I am
Im not even taking the bags I got at the station
What the hellya got in there   She put the suitcase down
My clothes she said
Im going with you
Can I Okay    What I said
I almost fell over when she said that
I swear to God I did
I got sort of dizzy and I thought I was going to pass out or something again
I took them down the back elevator so Charlene wouldnt see me
It isnt heavy
All I have in it is two dresses and my moccasins and my underwear and socks and some other things
Feel it
It isnt heavy
Feel it once
Cant I go with you Holden Cant I Please
No
Shut up
I thought I was going to pass out cold
I mean I didnt mean to tell her to shut up and all but I thought I was going to pass out again
Why cant I Please Holden I wont do anything  Ill just go with you thats all I wont even take my clothes with me if you dont want me to Ill just take my    You cant take anything
Because youre not going
Im going alone
So shut up
Please Holden
Please let me go
Ill be very very very You wont even    Youre not going
Now shut up Gimme that bag I said
I took the bag off her
I was almost all set to hit her I thought I was going to smack her for a second
I really did
She started to cry
I thought you were supposed to be in a play at school and all I thought you were supposed to be Benedict Arnold in that play and all I said
I said it very nasty
Whuddaya want to do Not be in the play for Gods sake That made her cry even harder
I was glad
All of a sudden I wanted her to cry till her eyes practically dropped out
I almost hated her
I think I hated her most because she wouldnt be in that play any more if she went away with me
Come on I said
I started up the steps to the museum again
I figured what Id do was Id check the crazy suitcase shed brought in the checkroom andy then she could get it again at three oclock after school
I knew she couldnt take it back to school with her
Come on now I said
She didnt go up the steps with me though
She wouldnt come with me
I went up anyway though and brought the bag in the checkroom and checked it and then I came down again
She was still standing there on the sidewalk but she turned her back on me when I came up to her
She can do that
She can turn her back on you when she feels like it
Im not going away anywhere
I changed my mind
So stop crying and shut up I said
The funny part was she wasnt even crying when I said that
I said it anyway though Cmon now
Ill walk you back to school
Cmon now
Youll be late
She wouldnt answer me or anything
I sort of tried to get hold of her old hand but she wouldnt let me
She kept turning around on me
Didja have your lunch Ya had your lunch yet I asked her
She wouldnt answer me
All she did was she took off my red hunting hat the one I gave her and practically chucked it right in my face
Then she turned her back on me again
It nearly killed me but I didnt say anything
I just picked it up and stuck it in my coat pocket
Come on hey
Ill walk you back to school I said
Im not going back to school
I didnt know what to say when she said that
I just stood there for a couple of minutes
You have to go back to school
You want to be in that play dont you You want to be Benedict Arnold dont you  No
Sure you do
Certainly you do
Cmon now lets go I said
In the first place Im not going away anywhere I told you
Im going home
Im going home as soon as you go back to school
First Im gonna go down to the station and get my bags and then Im gonna go straight    I said Im not going back to school
You can do what you want to do but Im not going back to chool she said
So shut up
It was the first time she ever told me to shut up
It sounded terrible
God it sounded terrible
It sounded worse than swearing
She still wouldnt look at me either and every time I sort of put my hand on her shoulder or something she wouldnt let me
Listen do you want to go for a walk I asked her
Do you want to take a walk down to the zoo If I let you not go back to school this afternoon and go for walk will you cut out this crazy stuff   She wouldnt answer me so I said it over again
If I let you skip school this afternoon and go for a little walk will you cut out the crazy stuff Will you go back to school tomorrow like a good girl   I may and I may not she said
Then she ran right the hell across the street without even looking to see if any cars were coming
Shes a madman sometimes
I didnt follow her though
I knew shed follow me so I started walking downtown toward the zoo on the park side of the street and she started walking downtown on the other goddam side of the street She wouldnt look over at me at all but I could tell she was probably watching me out of the corner of her crazy eye to see where I was going and all
Anyway we kept walking that way all the way to the zoo
The only thing that bothered me was when a double-decker bus came along because then I couldnt see across the street and I couldnt see where the hell she was
But when we got to the zoo I yelled over to her Phoebe Im going in the zoo Cmon now She wouldnt look at me but I could tell she heard me and when I started down the steps to the zoo I turned around and saw she was crossing the street and following me and all
There werent too many people in the zoo because it was sort of a lousy day but there were a few around the sea lions swimming pool and all
I started to go by but old Phoebe stopped and made out she was watching the sea lions getting fed a guy was throwing fish at them so I went back
I figured it was a good chance to catch up with her and all
I went up and sort of stood behind her and sort of put my hands on her shoulders but she bent her knees and slid out from me she can certainly be very snotty when she wants to
She kept standing there while the sea lions were getting fed and I stood right behind her
I didnt put my hands on her shoulders again or anything because if I had she really wouldve beat it on me
Kids are funny
You have to watch what youre doing
She wouldnt walk right next to me when we left the sea lions but she didnt walk too far away
She sort of walked on one side of the sidewalk and I walked on the other side
It wasnt too gorgeous but it was better than having her walk about a mile away from me like before
We went up and watched the bears on that little hill for a while
but there wasnt much to watch
Only one of the bears was out the polar bear
The other one the brown one was in his goddam cave and wouldnt come out
All you could see was his rear end
There was a little kid standing next to me with a cowboy hat on practically over his ears and he kept telling his father Make him come out Daddy
Make him come out
I looked at old Phoebe but she wouldnt laugh
You know kids when theyre sore at you
They wont laugh or anything
After we left the bears we left the zoo and crossed over this little street in the park and then we went through one of those little tunnels that always smell from somebodys taking a leak
It was on the way to the carrousel
Old Phoebe still wouldnt talk to me or anything but she was sort of walking next to me now
I took a hold of the belt at the back of her coat just for the hell of it but she wouldnt let me
She said Keep your hands to yourself if you dont mind
She was still sore at me
But not as sore as she was before
Anyway we kept getting closer and closer to the carrousel and you could start to hear that nutty music it always plays
It was playing Oh Marie It played that same song about fifty years ago when I was a little kid
Thats one nice thing about carrousels they always play the same songs
I thought the carrousel was closed in the wintertime old Phoebe said
It was the first time she practically said anything
She probably forgot she was supposed to be sore at me
Maybe because its around Christmas I said
She didnt say anything when I said that
She probably remembered she was supposed to be sore at me
Do you want to go for a ride on it I said
I knew she probably did
When she was a tiny little kid and Allie and DB and I used to go to the park with her she was mad about the carrousel
You couldnt get her off the goddam thing
Im too big
she said
I thought she wasnt going to answer me but she did
No youre not
Go on
Ill wait for ya
Go on I said
We were right there then
There were a few kids riding on it mostly very little kids and a few parents were waiting around outside sitting on the benches and all
What I did was I went up to the window where they sell the tickets and bought old Phoebe a ticket
Then I gave it to her
She was standing right next to me
Here I said
Wait a second take the rest of your dough too
I started giving her the rest of the dough shed lent me
You keep it
Keep it for me she said
Then she said right afterward Please
Thats depressing when somebody says please to you
I mean if its Phoebe or somebody
That depressed the hell out of me
But I put the dough back in my pocket
Arent you gonna ride too she asked me
She was looking at me sort of funny
You could tell she wasnt  too sore at me any more
Maybe I will the next time
Ill watch ya I said
Got your ticket  Yes
Go ahead then Ill be on this bench right over here
Ill watch ya
I went over and sat down on this bench and she went and got on the carrousel
She walked all around it
I mean she walked once all the way around it
Then she sat down on this big brown beat-up-looking old horse
Then the carrousel started and I watched her go around and around
There were only about five or six other kids on the ride and the song the carrousel was playing was Smoke Gets in Your Eyes
It was playing it very jazzy and funny
All the kids kept trying to grab for the gold ring and so was old Phoebe and I was
sort of afraid shed fall off the goddam horse but I didnt say anything or do anything
The thing with kids is if they want to grab the gold ring you have to let them do it and not say anything
If they fall off they fall off but its bad if you say anything to them
When the ride was over she got off her horse and came over to me
You ride once too this time she said
No Ill just watch ya
I think Ill just watch I said
I gave her some more of her dough
Here
Get some more tickets
She took the dough off me
Im not mad at you any more she said
I know
Hurry up the things gonna start again
Then all of a sudden she gave me a kiss
Then she held her hand out and said Its raining
Its starting to rain
I know
Then what she did it damn near killed me she reached in my coat pocket and took out my red hunting hat and put it on my head
Dont you want it I said
You can wear it a while
Okay
Hurry up though now
Youre gonna miss your ride
You wont get your own horse or anything
She kept hanging around though
Did you mean it what you said You really arent going away anywhere Are you really going home afterwards she asked me
Yeah I said
I meant it too
I wasnt lying to her
I really did go home afterwards
Hurry up now I said
The things starting
She ran and bought her ticket and got back on the goddam carrousel just in time
Then she walked all the way around it till she got her own horse back
Then she got on it
She waved to me and I waved back
Boy it began to rain like a bastard
In buckets I swear to God
All the parents and mothers and everybody went over and stood right under the roof of the carrousel so they wouldnt get soaked to the skin or anything but I stuck around on the bench for quite a while
I got pretty soaking wet especially my neck and my pants
My hunting hat really gave me quite a lot of protection in a way; but I got soaked anyway
I didnt care though
I felt so damn happy all of sudden the way old Phoebe kept going around and around
I was damn near bawling I felt so damn happy if you want to know the truth
I dont know why
It was just that she looked so damn nice the way she kept going around and around in her blue coat  and all
God I wish you couldve been there
Thats all Im going to tell about
I could probably tell you what I did after I went home and how I got sick and all and what school Im supposed to go to next fall after I get out of here but I dont feel like it
I really dont
That stuff doesnt interest me too much right now
A lot of people especially this one psychoanalyst guy they have here keeps asking me if Im going apply myself when I go back to school next September
Its such a stupid question in my opinion
I mean how do you know what youre going to do till you
do it The answer is you dont
I think I am but how do I know I swear its a stupid question
DB isnt as bad as the rest of them but he keeps asking me a lot of questions too
He drove over last Saturday with this English babe thats in this new picture hes writing
She was pretty affected but very good-looking
Anyway one time when she went to the ladies room way the hell down in the other wing DB asked me what I thought about all this stuff I just finished telling you about
I didnt know what the hell to say
If you want to know the truth I dont know what I think about it
Im sorry I told so many people about it
About all I know is I sort of miss everybody I told about
Even old Stradlater and Ackley for instance
I think I even miss that goddam Maurice
Its funny
Dont ever tell anybody anything
If you do you start missing everybody
